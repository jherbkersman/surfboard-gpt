Too Fish



An evolution of Rob's popular "Go Fish' model from 2017,

updated with lessons he learned from the Seaside, this all new

Too Fish model is built in Firewire Surfboards Helium Technology

for light and lively response underfoot with significant durability

improvements above other surfboard building methods given the

use of aerospace deck skins on the top and bottom of the board,

as well as a rail comprised of paulownia and balsa wood for

controlled flex and rebound in turns.



Rob says that the Too Fish is :



"My favorite in small and weak waves because of how thick and

floaty it is in the forward two thirds of the board, but this shape is

also thinned out aggressively in the tail to enable hold in powerful

waves. I've ridden the Too Fish in everything from overhead

waves on the North Shore to perfect days on the reef at home,

and also the weakest most disorganized junk surf at the beach

break in front of my house. This is my favorite board for all

conditions."



FRK PLUS IBOLIC



The FRK Plus is a classic squash tail, high performance shortboard, refined and calibrated over the past three years with Kelly, Brodi, Betty Lou, and

others.



This new squash version of the FRK is meant to be ridden slightly shorter than the original FRK round tail. It has all the on-wave benefits of the original FRK with a touch more release through turns that comes from the squash tail and minor adjustments to how the concaves and fin placements relate to the increased surface area of the squash when compared to a round

tail.



The feedback on this shape has been that it has a super quick rail to rail responsiveness mixed with extremely good drive and release: Most intermediate and above surfers will appreciate the FRK Plus for the way this shape gets out of your way to the point that you don’t even notice it's there - it feels like the most high performance expression of your intentions possible.

Seaside



HEY ROB, WHAT IS THE SEASIDE..?



Just evolving the Go Fish to something new, really. The Go Fish goes fast and feels skatey and loose and I love it, and riding it for a couple years made me want to feel more high performance - more carves, tighter turns. So the Seaside is about refining… less area in the tail, narrowing the tips of the swallow, creating more curve and narrowing the nose. All elements for ripping while the Go Fish stays cruisey and fun.



The Seaside is quad only, why?



I decided that if i was going to make a quad I would make a quad that’s strictly a quad ... Design the concaves and bottom contours around that. I actually redesigned my entire concave setup that I’ve been using on the Moonbeam and Go Fish, and did it with the quad setup in mind so that it all works together.



Why name this shape after your home break, Seaside?



Naming surfboards might be the hardest thing to do on the planet [laughing]. It’s just the perfect little stick when I surf my home spot, Seaside.



Why is the Seaside built in Helium?



The first one I made for Tahiti was LFT and I was riding it in 6 foot tubes. But most everyone surfs a shape like the Seaside at beach breaks and little point breaks, so we made it in Helium because it’s really light, very responsive, really flexy with a softer feel and very durable. It’s the best option for a shape like the Seaside in smaller, weaker waves, I think.

Volcanic Seaside



Volcanic Tech is made from Basalt Fibers Extruded from Volcanic Rocks that are crushed, melted and extruded into woven fibers that make up the cloth. The manufacture of basalt fiber requires the melting of the crushed and washed basalt rock at about 1,500 °C (2,730 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles to produce continuous filaments of basalt fiber. Those filaments are then chopped into long stem fibers and woven into lamination cloth fiber. The cloth has similar characteristics to carbon as it relates to strength and weight however because the fibers are derived from Organic Raw materials, when combined with Bio Resins it serves as better degradable ECO alternative than using traditional carbon fiber cloth.



Basalt fiber is a relative newcomer to fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) and structural composites. It has a similar chemical composition as glass fiber but has better strength characteristics, and unlike most glass fibers is highly resistant to alkaline, acidic and salt attack making it a good candidate for surfboard manufacturing.



Compared to carbon and aramid fiber, it has the features of wider application temperature range -452° F to 1,200° F (-269° C to +650° C), higher oxidation resistance, higher radiation resistance, higher compression strength, and higher shear strength.



 The cloth can withstand high temperatures unlike carbon fiber and as a result is heavily used the Aerospace industry in the creation of rockets and and jet engines. The elasticity characteristics of this fiber is higher than that of traditional Carbon fiber allowing the board to have more flex for a natural feel under foot.

Mashup



Two minds combined.



Rob Machado and Dan Mann have created the Mashup: A melding of each of their most popular designs; the Seaside and the Spitfire.



Both board designers have spent time mixing and matching their favorite elements of each shape, and they’ve landed at something that goes fast in weak waves as well as a Seaside, and also drives vertically in good waves as well as the Spitfire.



The Mashup is the ultimate groveler. And the ultimate everyday board as well.



 Built in Helium Technology, it’s one of our absolute favourite boards for 2022.

The Sweet Potato



" Small wave grovel, fast and fun. The Sweet Potato is probably the widest, flattest rockered, most thick surfboard you will ever surf. You can now ride a shortboard in lineups traditionally ruled by long boarders. 



 Keep it in your trunk so that you can always surf it in the junk, because from buttery floaters to no-paddle takeoffs, our new Sweet Potato is my favorite small wave surfboard. 



It's high performance but it's definitely a groveler. The Helium Sweet Potato is the absolute most fun you can have in really bad waves."



-Dan Mann

 



The NEW Sweet Potato is the refined swallowtail version of the original Sweet Potato - the board that transformed what surfing is for me (and I hope many others). The Sweet Potato converts waves that would normally require a longboard (or even just be a non-surf day) into loads and loads of fun because of the insane amount of volume packed into a very short board that is loose and packs tons of drive. The trademark deep double barrel concave essentially splits the board in half when tipped over and driving through turns, making the board feel way more narrow than it actually is. The new tail outline, combined with some tweaks on the bottom contours through the fins, has increased the maneuverability for tighter pocket turns without taking away the projection and grovel speed in gutless surf.

IBOLIC FRK



In 2015 I was asked to shape Kelly a board for the first time. 



 I knew immediately what I wanted to make him. 



 I saw it all in my head immediately; from the bottom contour to the tail template. The way the volume would distribute through the width, the whole shape… It might actually be the most intuitive design I’ve ever done, probably because I’ve spent so many years both watching Kelly surf, and shaping boards.



As crazy as it sounds I was certain it would work for him. Totally certain.



 The odd thing is, after sending him the board in 2015, I never heard from Kelly about how the board went, and I sort of just moved on to other stuff. 



 Then one afternoon in 2017 I got this stream of text messages one day about how Kelly was blowing up at Trestles on my board. It totally caught me off guard. Just text messages and phone calls flying in from everyone.



 I sorted through everyone’s messages and learned that Kelly’s good friend from Florida who was in town at the time had grabbed the board from Kelly’s shed where it had sat un-surfed for two years. 



 He surfed it and then told Kelly that Kelly would love it based on having known Kelly his whole life, and having a good idea about what boards he likes and doesn’t like, based on all the times the two of them had swapped boards before. 



IBOLIC TECHNOLOGY



Patent Pending technology build into the core blank construction create preloaded structural flex together with structure strength and durability. 



Fiber  Reinforced I-Beam down center with Parabolic Rail Springers from nose to tail.

Anyway, thankfully Kelly took his friends advice and loved the board from the first turn. 



 



Kelly actually said he knew the FRK was a keeper before he’d even completed his first wave on it. Two weeks later he took it to J Bay and did what a lot of people called his best surfing of the year. 



 



Since that contest, he’s ridden the FRK everywhere in videos and at key events like the Founders Cup, J Bay again in 2018, and the Surf Ranch Pro. He’s also surfed it all around the North Shore this Winter. 



 



Actually the FRKs he’s been riding this Winter have been straight out of Firewire’s factory, and I’m stoked we were able to so smoothly transition the custom FRKs I’ve been making him since 17’ into the final version from Firewire’s factory that will be at surf shops everywhere. To see Kelly embrace the shape and build exactly as it will hit surf shops is awesome.

If I had to describe the nuts and bolts of the FRKs design, I’d simply say it’s made to make you forget it’s there. 

When designing boards for Kelly I’m trying to remove as many variables as possible and make it something that can level up his talents, or the talents of other surfers, without any glitches, or ever feeling like its in your way. 

I can’t wait to see everyone riding it in 19’.

DOMINATOR 2.0



The Dominator II is a revisited version that I’m super excited about. The Dominator has been a staple in my quiver, and the Firewire line, since its inception in 2008. The DM II is meant to be a clean update of the original with design features that allow it to work well in a wider range of conditions and enhance its performance. 



The obvious outline change is the tail going to a squash from the round tail. Also, the rails are slightly more refined and performance oriented. The concave is the same under the front foot but splits into a subtle, double-barrel and V out the tail in the last 5”. I normally look for a round tail to provide smoothness in transition from rail to rail and during turns, but the squash tail is proving to not only have that quality as well, but also a bit more release in the turns.

Revo



The REVO is the latest update to the now famous, TOMO EVO. Featuring Vee Quad Concave (VQC)The cutting edge in performance hull design'. Vee Quad Concave (VQC) combines the exceptional maneuverability and rail-to-rail transitions of a vee hull with the lift and response of quad concave to provide the most unique, high performance surfing experience we have ever offered! The higher lift-to-drag coefficient allows for easy wave catching and speedy transitions while maintaining a controlled feel attributed to the balanced 'rectangular' template of the Modern Planing Hul (MPH). The REVO has a more refined outline curve and a higher rocker to its predecessor, allowing this design to perform more radical lines closer to the pocket of the wave. A fantastic quad fin design as the "deep central spine' of the vee provides plenty of directional control. The design can still be ridden as a thruster, though it is recommended to use a smaller rear fin - or a 2+1 setup.

Sci-Fi 2.0



The update to one of the most popular designs in surfing has arrived. The Sci-Fi 2.0 features a wide point forward of center, which allows the design to be ridden 1” shorter than its predecessor with more volume packed into shorter length. It also has a more pulled-in tail and rocker (similar to the Cymatic) giving the design greater range than the original, while still maintaining good small wave prowess

Cymatic



The Cymatic is an avant-garde, ultra high performance machine.



This shape is a hybrid of the Sci-Fi and Omni models so obviously, you can almost imagine the two boards combining naturally one night with Tomo away from the shaping bay.



Fans of the Sci-Fi will immediately notice Tomo’s double bat tail. Much of the Sci-Fi’s popularity in 2016 and 2017 has been this tail design coupled with Tomo’s Quad Inside Single Concave.



Functionally, the marriage of these two design elements has been brilliant - the double bat adding much needed grip to the wave’s face, offsetting the extreme lift and speed created by the Quad Inside Single Concave.



By melding these elements with the reduced swing weight of the Omni’s nose, Daniel Tomson has created an evolved version of both boards that surfs most similarly to the Sci-Fi but with slightly more rocker, and an increased ease of use in waves 1 to 5 feet.



When it comes to waves of size though, surfers who love that familiar ‘barely out of control in a fun way’ speed when the waves creep above head high will appreciate this board’s feel in proper waves as well.



Both Kelly Slater and Daniel Thomson have surfed and signed off on this shape in 2017 and we can’t wait to present it in 2018 as the next evolution of Tomo’s minimalistic, and highly engineered, modern planning hulls for Slater Designs.

Evo Helium



The Evo is the pinnacle of Daniel Thomson’s Modern Planing Hull designs, shaped into accessible dimensions and fit for surfers from beginner to advanced.



It was this shape in 2014 that began Daniel’s path towards refining his Quad Inside Single Concave - a design principle that has since pollinated across every shape he designs, while the Evo continues to maintain its position as one of the most easy to surf shapes on earth.



This model was first released in LFT in 2014. And there it stayed until this year when we made it available in Timbertek for the first time. We’ve since learned that the Timbertek version is often a favorite among many who prefer quick thrust towards the shoulder and big hacks on rail, while the LFT version has been favored by those with a more up and down approach in the pocket and in the lip.



Today we’re excited to release what we believe is the best version of the Evo yet. This shape is now built in Helium - so light it shocks you and so responsive it talks to you. And most importantly, combining the best of both Timbertek and LFT.



The Helium Rail, built using a combination of Paulownia and Balsa wood creates the same on-rail sensations as the TImbertek Evo, while the Helium deckskin and incredibly light foam core bring this shape to a weight measurement even lower than its LFT cousin.



Among Firewire employees, this is the shape we’re most anticipating in our own quivers as 2017 comes to a close.

Houdini



Making it easy to disappear and reappear in Hawaiian tubes, the Houdini is our new magic act for Hawaiian waves, or other locations, where controlled lines through racy barrels are a must.



The magic started in ‘18 between Wade and Kelly - and a year later it arrived.



The Houdini has been a staple under Kelly’s feet for the 2019 WSL season, with both big face gouges at Margaret’s and remarkable makes at Pipeline on its resume.



The bottom contour consists of a single to double with slight vee, in spite of its step-up frame, the Houdini has incredible acceleration and maneuverability.



The Houdini model sticks with Kelly’s previously proven formula for his personal step-ups: hiding volume under his chest for better paddling, but maintaining a tapered rail for sensitivity.



It’s available now in LFT, with five fin boxes for optionality.

Greedy Beaver



The Greedy Beaver has a real shortboard feel with a compressed longboard outline, a true crossover board with midlength retro glide and shortboard maneuverability. Put it on rail while engaging the single to double concave, step on the rounded pin and it surfs like a shortboard in the pocket. Or take advantage of the single to double concave and large planing surface to trim effortlessly over dead sections. The beveled rail reduces the overall thickness, adding performance including rapid direction changes.



Raise your wave count every session with the paddle power of the Greedy Beaver while turning on a dime as you thread your way through the pack.

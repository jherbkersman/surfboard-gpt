RED TIGER



Silky smooth, even in junk waves, and possibly our fastest board yet, The Red Tiger is John John Florence's new High Performance Shortboard unlike anything we have released in the past.





It is the ultimate performance machine for small/medium sized, slower, weaker waves based on John's simple guidance - make it Fast and Fun.

The idea for this board was hatched when John began riding some different - fun boards -during some breaks from competing. By far his favorite in the last year has been our new flat rockered, Funformance board, the White Tiger (5'6"), and he asked me to turn that design into something he could take back on tour to ride when the surf was less than pumping or on the weaker side.



The outline is a touch on the plump side for a HPSB, but the wide point sits a more traditional inch behind center, keeping the emphasis to surfing it off the mid to back half of the board. The wider tail-block squash helps to keep area in the tail which provides lift and drive, and also helps create pop when going to the air. A moderate hip by the front fins puts a break in the outline to help create a pivot point that allows for tighter radius turns and release in the lip.



The rocker and bottom contour is really what sets this board from other boards in this category. Its our flattest HPSB so far and that rocker translates to easy, consistent speed from the moment you stand up, through flat sections and even in super weak, small waves. But, flat rocker can feel sticky and tends to make you surf flat, so we run single to double concave (JJF's favorite bottom contour) through the front 2/3 of the board and then blend that into a significant double concave/deep vee combo through the fins and off the tail. This bottom keeps the flatter board easy to roll rail-to-rail and the vee of the tail works to allow easy vertical surfing and short-arc carves, even in tight, pockety waves.



The thickness flow (foil) from nose to tail is balanced and clean, with the front of the board just barely thinner than the back half. The deck is flat-ish, keeping more foam (volume) out towards the rails. The actual rails are full just in from the outline (under the ball of your hand if you are holding the board under your arm), but are tapered to keep sensitivity and bite.



Ride your Red Tiger around an inch shorter than normal HPSB, and a bit wider. Volume should be close, but go up a ½ to1 liter for added zing in weaker waves. The board will easily turn your everyday sessions into something special and we believe it will outperform any other HPSB in underpar waves AND still come through when the surf turns on!



Pyzel board agents personally recommend rocking the JJF Techflex Futures or FCS II Performer fins with your Red Tiger.



GHOST



The design that JJF rode to two consecutive World Titles! The Ghost is possibly the first truly High Performance board that works great for all levels of surfer and could be considered a one-board quiver for any surf trip with decent to good waves on the menu.





A super versatile board, it has become one of JJF's favorites for all kinds of surf (Margaret River winner, Bells Ollie Oop, J-Bay carves, and even head-high Trestles) and a go-to for many surfers around the world.



Originally designed for performance in hollower, more powerful types of waves, the Ghost has proven to be great for reef breaks, dumpy beachies, and also excels in point waves.



Based off of our Short Cut, The Ghost outline is more refined: it still has the wide point pushed a bit forward of center, but the nose area is kept down and the tail slightly pulled in to help it fit into a tighter curve.



The thickness is also pushed forward, which helps even more with getting you into waves easily, and we kept the tail and rails thinned out to help hold through barrels and turns at speed.



The rocker is med/low through the front half to get you into waves easily and pick up speed quickly. The rear end has plenty of rocker curve for turning control and a snappy responsiveness. Single concave runs through the entire bottom, with a double concave set inside, which equals speed and lift both on a rail and over flat spots while allowing for quick rail-to-rail transitions. The Ghost's combination of rocker and concave makes for high performance handling through a healthy mix of sensitivity and control.



Depending on what you want to ride it in we recommend you order your Ghosts anywhere from your height to 8" over, a 1/4" to 1/2" wider, and 1/8" to 3/8" thicker than your everyday shorty. Stock boards all have 5-fin set up.



Comes with a round tail, but we can custom make it with any tail you like.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF Techflex or FCS II PERFORMER PC fins in your Ghost.

RED TIGER XL



The XL version is exactly the same, with stock dims built to suit the bigger, stockier surfer, or for more novice surfers looking to level-up in their surfing by downsizing to a smaller board.





Silky smooth, even in junk waves, and possibly our fastest board yet, The Red Tiger is John John Florences new High Performance Shortboard unlike anything we have released in the past. It is the ultimate performance machine for medium sized, slower, weaker waves, based on Johns simple guidance - make it Fast and Fun.

GHOST PRO



The Ghost Pro is the slimmed down dims version of the exact same design that JJF rode two consecutive World Titles.





The Ghost Pro is a possibly the first truly High Performance board that works great for all levels of surfer and could be considered a one-board quiver for any surf trip with decent to good waves on the menu.

HIGHLINE



Want to maximize your surfing performance even when the waves are less than perfect? The High Line is a new High Performance Shortboard that we have developed with feedback from John & Nathan Florence, Tyler Wright, Nic Von Rupp and the majority of our junior team riders around the world.





Since its release, we've seen the Highline take over contest quivers of riders like Tyler Wright, who took to the podium two years in a row at the 22' & 23' WSL Bells Beach contests riding her 5'8" Highline.

Designed to excel in average-to-good waves, and based off our popular and versatile "74" model (winner of Dane Reynolds' 2016 Stab in the Dark).



We left the rocker unchanged, but updated the foil and outline to fit our idea of a modern HPSB.



The bottom features a medium/high nose rocker and medium tail rocker for extra drive in sluggish conditions. It has single concave all the way through the bottom, blended with a double concave between the fins. These combinations of contours and curves generate lift for quick acceleration, holding speed and drive, and help the board roll from rail to rail with ease.



The outline wide point is just back from center and it has a pronounced hip that adds drive while creating a pivot point that allows for snappy, vertical surfing.



As with the "74", the deck is slightly flatter than our other boards, with more volume pushed out towards the rail. The rail itself is refined, not boxy, keeping it sensitive and easy to push through turns.



When compared to our Radius model (as these two are similar to each other in our range), the Radius has more overall rocker and is more suited to punchy waves with some curve in the face.



The High Line's rocker is slightly flatter, nose and tail, and thus tends to hold more speed in weaker waves and carry speed through flatter waves more easily, while still having enough rocker to allow for easy vertical surfing.



Additionally the Highline stock sizing has a bit more width and volume per size (most are about ½ to 1 liter more volume) so that adds float and carry in smaller waves.



To put it simply the High Line is a great high-performance board for good to below-average waves. It will help you make the most of your everyday surfs and elevate your surfing performance.



We recommend you ride it at anywhere from an inch under to an inch over your height and at your favorite performance surfboard volume.

SHADOW





The new high-performance shortboard addition to the Ghost family.





Already a favorite of John John Florence, Jack Freestone and the rest of our team, its the board that lets you surf how you want in a wide range of wave conditions and size.

Knowing that the Phantom is a great board for many types of conditions, Jon decided to start with there and redesign it as a more refined, high performance board, while still keeping the added flow and glide that defines the Phantom.



The Shadow is designed to give all surfers the advantages of a wider, forward outlined type of board, but in a sleek, High Performance package.



✪ Modern foil/outline brings improved stability, paddle power, easy speed/flow in weaker waves.



✪ Rocker and bottom contours combine to generate speed and allow tight, powerful turning in all conditions.



✪ Great for all types of waves from beach breaks to points, reefs and even slabs.



✪ Will help Intermediate surfers elevate their performance levels, while also bringing out the best in more advanced surfers.



The Shadow features a high performance outline, the wide point at center not behind as is typical of most other HPSBs. We pulled in the nose by almost a ½ inch and added rocker through the last 12 in the nose to keep it freed up through critical turns.



It has a gentle hip for added sensitivity and looseness, and the squash tail is pulled in a touch to tighten the turning radius and improve vertical surfing capability.



Tail rocker and bottom concave remain similar to the Phantom, already proven to work well in everyday conditions around the world.



The thickness flow sets the Shadow apart from other HPSBs, keeping the volume more forward of center but not overly exaggerated. Added foam under the chest area helps add paddle power and gives extra float under your front foot in slower sections, meaning easy speed and flow.



Ride the Shadow your height to an inch over, in your favorite high performance dimensions.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF Techflex or FCS II PERFORMER PC fins in your Shadow.

SHADOW XL



The Shadow XL is our larger dims/volume version of the newest addition to the Ghost family, built for surfers looking for the performance of a traditional shortboard with a more modern outline in larger dimensions.





The Shadow was awarded SIMA Shortboard of the Year for 2019.



Already a favorite of John John Florence, Jack Freestone and the rest of our team, its the board that lets you surf how you want in a wide range of wave conditions and size.

74



The 74 was chosen by Dane Reynolds as the 2016 Board of the Year in the Stab in the Dark blind surfboard test, and is designed with better waves and high performance surfing in mind.





Built off the original hand shape made for Dane, the outline is clean, with a mild hip in the tail.



The bottom rocker is medium/high, which generates speed and drive, while keeping the board loose and responsive.



A single concave throughout the bottom adds lift, projection and more drive.



The deck is a bit flatter than our other models, which adds some extra volume out towards the rail (providing extra float and paddle power) but the rail itself is less boxy, for sensitivity.



Designed to work best in punchy beach breaks, reef waves or lined up points, the 74 will not let you down.

RADIUS



Jordy Smith's choice for best board in 2017's Stab In The Dark, our 2018 Radius is the latest incarnation of our top high performance design, the Bastard, John John Florence's go-to board for his World Title run in 2016 and



Jon Pyzel and JJF have refined the design even further over the last year and it continues to be a favorite among all high-perfomrnace surfers



Designed to be ridden fast and loose in above average to great surf, the Radius has a smooth, medium/high bottom rocker for easy turning and a single concave to add lift and drive.





The gentle hip in the outline keeps it lively and sharp, while adding drive.

Proven in everything from the beach breaks of Rio and France, the point waves of J Bay and Trestles, and the reefs of the South Pacific and Indonesia, it feels best in surf with a little curve on the face, and just keeps getting better as it gets into more juice.



The Radius is as high performance as we go, so not the best choice for beginners, but if you are looking to elevate your surfing up another level this board will get you there.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF Techflex or FCS II PERFORMER PC fins in your Radius.



PHANTOM



The Phantom is the middle child in the Ghost Family, a step-down version of John John Florence's current favorite model (the Ghost) and designed to be your go-to board for everyday conditions.





When we first brought out the Ghost we had no idea that it's unique design would come to be embraced by so many people in so many different types of waves. However, the feedback we kept hearing was that it was best in waves shoulder-high and up, so we looked at making a step-down board that would bring that same feel to the head-high and under days that make up most of our daily surf sessions.



The Phantom is a Ghost squashed down, souped up, and with added volume, great for your everyday sessions in less than epic conditions.



We left the same Ghost rocker but added more single concave to flatten it out through the center, helping to create speed and flow without taking away from the overall performance or feel of the original design.

The added width in the tail and nose create a more parallel, fuller outline that helps keep speed up through slower sections and tight turns.

The rails are full but not chunky, giving you more floatation and speed without taking away the sensitivity that we all love in our boards.

Best in waist-high to overhead waves of all types the Phantom is your daily driver with a high performance edge.

Ride it around your height, a touch wider and about the same thickness as your Ghost.

Pyzel board agents personally recommend rocking the JJF Techflex Futures or FCS II Performer fins with your Phantom.



PYZALIEN 2



An amazing option for the One Board Quiver- The Pyzalien 2 is a fresh take on an older favorite!



For years the original Pyzalien has been an all-time favorite model, so we decided to take a fresh approach to it and release the new and improved Pyzalien 2 for 2020.





Back when the Original came out it was a lot different than the shortboards of the time- wide point forward outline, wider overall in the nose, with the thickness flow pushed forward as well. It was designed to be ridden shorter/wider than your normal boards, but still have the volume needed to make it work well in weaker waves. 10+ years later and the Pyzalien still looks a little different, but most modern shortboard designs have shifted in a similar direction.



The Pyzalien 2 works great in a huge variety of waves, from points to reefs to beach break, and has one of the most user friendly, yet high performance rockers weve made, smooth and clean, with med/low entry running through to med+ tail rocker. The bottom has a single concave starting in the nose, running under the front foot, blending into double concave and then VEE in the last 6 inches of the tail which adds release that helps ease you into turns. This rocker/bottom combo gives the board quick, effortless speed from take-off, while increasing the responsiveness and control, allowing for easier rail to rail transitions at high speeds. The outline is clean and simple, no hips or wings just a fuller nose and wider tail which keeps the board very fast and drivey, making for easy flow through flatter sections. One of the biggest changes from the Original is a more domed deck with refined rails, so we recommend that you order it the same thickness, 1/4 to 1/2 inch wider and 2-3 inches shorter than your standard shortboard. Comes standard with a clean swallow tail for added snappiness and spark! This is a great Daily Driver board with a High Performance personality, built for most levels of surfer, from novice to Pro.

MINI GHOST-SQUASH



The Mini Ghost came to be as a result of working with Koa Smith to build a rippable short, chunky, fun version of one of our favorite boards, the Ghost.





Koa loves riding tiny boards for the smaller days on the North Shore, but we needed to pack more volume into them to make them functional and give them paddle power and stability.

We shrunk Koas 5-9 Ghost down to a 5-5 and to give it more float we widened it up a touch, flattened out the deck and made the rails thicker and more boxy. We also added a modern beak nose to keep even more foam under the chest-area and up into the nose. The volume added is significant - a 5-10 Ghost XL is 28.80 liters, while a 5-7 Mini Ghost comes in at 28.70 liters! We made a few small changes to the rocker and it comes in either a round tail, or a wider bump squash to make the board very fun in smaller, weaker waves.



Overall the best way to describe it is a sort of throwback 80s looking board with all the added performance features of a modern design. Its made for high performance ripping, but is also great for less skilled surfers due to the added volume and forgiving ride.

Meant to be ridden 3-4 inches shorter, and around the same volume as your normal shortboard, the Mini Ghost will give your surfing a fresh feel and keep you happy in all kinds of conditions and types of waves.

WHITE TIGER



The White Tiger is the latest offering in our Funformance category - a fun, stubby little board designed for average/below average waves.





It gets up and goes easily, flies through the weakest sections, but still lets you smash the lip and boost airs along the way.

The very first one was a side project board for John John Florence, who rarely rides "fun" boards, just sticks to pure performance. It sat in his garage for maybe a year, and in the meantime I made a few for his little brother Ivan. It was the perfect design to fit Ivan's surf/skate style and soon he was telling us how much he loved it and sending us clips of him doing big carves and boosting airs on it. Finally JJF pulled his 5'6" out and was immediately having a blast on it too. Now its one of John's favorite boards to ride whenever he has some time off from the tour and just wants to play around with something different.



Here's the basic info on what makes the White Tiger go-



It has a clean but stubby outline, with a very full nose and wide squash tail. There is no hip and the wide point is 1 ½" forward of the center. The tail measurement is just slightly wider than the nose.



The thickness is also concentrated forward, with a beak-nose design that helps keep the volume up under the chest area for better paddle power.



The bottom rocker is even and flowing, flat throughout the board and designed to get up on top of the water quickly, which lets you build and carry speed with ease.



The bottom has a single/double concave running through the front 2/3s of the board which transitions into a pronounced vee/double concave in the last 1/3 through the fins and off the end of the tail. The single/double concave give the board lots of lift (think speed) while helping to let the wider design transition from rail to rail with ease. The vee running off the tail also helps the board tip over onto the rail at speed and lets you turn it up into the lip with ease.



It has a relatively flat deck that blends out into tapered rails. This keeps a lot of volume in the board while still keeping it sensitive through turns and easy to pump down the line without feeling too boaty for its volume.



We recommend you ride the White Tiger anywhere from 2-5" shorter than your regular shortboard depending on your surfing ability, and ½ to 1" wider and add a bit more volume than you normally ride. (JJF and Ivan both ride 5'6" White Tigers and their normal boards are 6'0").

WILDCAT



Fast, Free, and Fun.





The Wildcat channel bottom twin is the second offering under our Velocity Project label, which we have been testing and refining with our team riders and friends over the past 2 years and its finally ready for everyone to enjoy.



Inspired by beautiful twin-fin designs of the past, built with my curves and contours. The boards look and feel timeless, yet allow the type of modern performance that we strive to bring to all our boards.



The bottom curve is clean, and relatively flat, offering great paddle speed and easy acceleration from the moment you get to your feet. A single/double concave runs throughout the bottom, blending into a moderate V and 4 channels running off the tail. All of this is designed to help the board roll from rail to rail, add a little extra bite off the bottom and quickly respond to weight shifts while easily flowing over softer sections of a wave. This helps increase your speed as you push it through turns.



The outline is a blend of traditional and modern as well, with the wide point just up from center, moderately wide nose and a classic single wing rounded pintail. The wing and the pin work in conjunction with the channels to provide both drive and maneuverability, allowing for snappy, pivoted turns and sweeping carves.



The nose is a refined beak (you know I love these), which lets us run a touch more thickness up under the chest area, keeping you more on top of the water while you paddle. The rails have a modern shortboard feel, but with extra foam taken off to aid in sensitivity and bite.



For sizing, go an inch or 2 under your Daily Driver type board, and a half inch to an inch wider and a touch more volume.



The speed, flow and easy surfing of this board is something we all love and its a benefit for any surfer in almost any type of wave.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the Bobcat Fins, a collaboration from Jon Pyzel & Bob Hurley in your Wildcat.



ASTRO POP



You want to go fast? Weʼve got the Funformance design that will give you another reason to get into the water all summer long.





The Astro Pop is designed to give you some extra spark and easy paddle in weaker, slower waves, while still keeping a performance edge and super fun to ride in good surf.

Built off of the Astro, the retro fish weʼve been making for years, the Astro Pop has a more pulled in nose and tail, with a little wing to help pull in the last 4 inches of the tail which creates a lot of curve in the outline, adding maneuverability without sacrificing any speed. The bottom has a deep double concave running through to vee off the tail which makes the board get up on top of the water in even slower, weaker waves and still easily tip over onto the rail at high speeds.



A mild beak nose helps keep the thickness up into the nose, but itʼs not overly chunky, more like a daily driver type board but with easy paddling aided by the flatter entry rocker. We recommend the Astro Pop as a quad, for speed, but it comes stock with a 5-fin setup to maximize versatility.



Ride it short as you want (mine is 5ʼ5) and about 3⁄4ʼʼ to 1ʼʼ wider, with a thickness that gives you a bit more volume than your everyday shortboard.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the Pyzel 5 fin or FCS II Performer Quad fins in your Astro Pop.

GREMLIN



If you love the feel of your Ghost and Phantom, but want a shorter, chunkier board for smaller surf the Gremlin is the board you are gonna want!



Based off the Ghost DNA, it's the Step-Down cousin to the Phantom, with lots of extra volume packed into a shorter, wider, flatter rockered package designed for quick acceleration, easily sustained speed and great paddle power.





The Gremlin was made to get you excited about surfing on the days that are less-than-epic, and also to give you a taste of FunFormance that will get you fired up in any kind of surf.

The wider outline is complimented by a low entry rocker for easy speed and glide through the weakest, slowest sections, but we left curve through the tail rocker to keep it performance oriented and add to maneuverability.



The bottom runs from single to double concave, with a nice bit of Vee running of the tail.



This makes it a board that paddles easy, gets up and goes fast, and still has a snappy, drivey, high-performance feel to get you the most out of every wave you catch.



Higher level surfers will want to ride this board as much as 4-6 inches below their height (and find that it actually has a full on high-performance side to it). A more intermediate level surfer will want to stick to something around their height.



It's also a great transitional board for the more beginner surfer who is ready to take the step away from their longboard (or whatever they have been riding) to a more FUNformance design! Whatever length suits you, it is meant to be ridden wider and thicker then your shortboard.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the Pyzel 5 fin or FCS II Performer Quad fins in your Gremlin.

MID LENGTH CRISIS



Jon has been making many different versions of mid-lengths, mostly customs ordered for surfers in Japan, but lately hes been building this one specific design for a bunch of his friends and a few select customers.





The response has been great, so weve decided to embrace the movement and offer our version of the mid-length to everyone.

Easy paddling, responsive and loose, the Mid Length Crisis has a semi-traditional, wide-point forward outline that is sleek and racey for fast, down-the-line drive, but full bodied enough to provide added stability and glide in weaker, slower waves.



It has a beautiful foil from nose to tail, with a rolled deck that leaves the meat in the middle of the board to help with paddling and nicely thinned out rails for sensitivity and bite.



The rocker is a moderate, long, clean curve running from tip to tail without any radical changes or flip. It is designed for fast paddling and to easily generate speed, carry flow, and smooth turning at any speed.



The bottom contours are a mild vee with double concave built into it (the old school term is Spiral Vee). This basically means that the board has no problem tipping from rail to rail, making smooth transitions through turns an easy accomplishment for all levels of surfer.



The fin set-up is 2+1 single box, which gives you options of single fin flowing or the added drive and control of some small side-bites. The stock glassing is 4 bottom and 6+4 deck for a little added weight and strength.



The Mid Length Crisis can be a fresh feeling addition to your quiver, and is a great board to have for those of you who want to try a new approach to the same waves youve been surfing forever.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the Futures Performance Single or FCS II Connect Single fin with your Mid Length Crisis. Single fin sizes depend on conditions, style, and size, so reach out to our board agents to find what will suit you best.



For bigger, faster waves or just more control we recommend adding FCS II Carver or Futures SB1 side bites to your Mid Length Crisis.

ASTRO POP XL



For fun days with a nice side of performance, the Astropop XL is the go to board for loose fun in all wave conditions.





The Astro Pop XL is designed to give you some extra spark and easy paddle in weaker, slower waves, while still keeping a performance edge and super fun to ride in good surf.



Built off of the Astro, the retro fish weʼve been making for years, the Astro Pop XL has a more pulled in nose and tail, with a little wing to help pull in the last 4 inches of the tail which creates a lot of curve in the outline, adding maneuverability without sacrificing any speed. The bottom has a deep double concave running through to vee off the tail which makes the board get up on top of the water in even slower, weaker waves and still easily tip over onto the rail at high speeds.



A mild beak nose helps keep the thickness up into the nose, but itʼs not overly chunky, more like a daily driver type board but with easy paddling aided by the flatter entry rocker. We recommend the Astro Pop XL as a quad, for speed, but it comes stock with a 5-fin setup to maximize versatility.



Ride it as short as you want (mine is 5ʼ5) and about 3⁄4ʼʼ to 1ʼʼ wider, with a thickness that gives you a bit more volume than your everyday shortboard.

ASTRO



The Astro Glider is our modern take on the Keel Fish of the 70's.





It is short, fast, and drivey. It has a extra-wide tail outline, combined with modern rocker and concave bottom that help bring out speed and performance, making it a super fun board. Not too boaty, just floaty and fast, this board works great in all kinds of waves, picks up speed easily, and turns with a smooth flow. Comes stock as a Quad for higher performance surfing, but you can also custom order with twin keels if you prefer that vibe.

Order it a little shorter than yourself, about 1" to 1 1/2" wider, and 1/4" thicker than your shortboard.



HAPPY TWIN



The Happy Twin is our modern take on the classic winged swallow twin fin.





Built for down the line speed and lightning fast turns, easy paddling and maximum fun.

It features a full, yet racy outline, with wide point forward (but not at all fish-y) , and a single wing right behind the front fins that creates a pivot point for snappy turns and bite.



The rocker is flatter for easy speed and lots of glide in slower surf, and the bottom design is a signature double concave within a single, blending into a pronounced Vee off the tail to ensure smooth, seamless rail to rail transitions.



The deck has a special, inset double concave shaped into the chest/front foot area that gives it that already "broken in" comfortable feeling on your very first surf. it also features an old school "beak" nose.



A rear fin box (or plug) allows for the use of a stabilizer to add some drive without taking away from the overall feeling of the twins.



The Happy Twin is a great addition to your quiver not only smaller surf, but also for a unique fast and free experience in more favorable conditions at nearly all wave types worldwide.



We recommend ordering your height or slightly under, around 1" wider and a touch thicker than your shortboard for a slightly increased overall volume and glide.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the FCS II MR or Futures T1 fins in your Happy Twin.

NEXT STEP



The Next Step up from your shortboard, this is a great board to have if you like to surf bigger waves than your shorty can handle, just down the road or on your dream surf trip.





It surfs loose, like a shortboard, but has the extra paddle-power and hold you need in solid surf.

Proven worldwide by the worlds best surfers, at places like Pipeline, Mainland Mexico, Tahiti, Fiji and Western Australia.



We recommend that you go anywhere from 2" to 8" up from your shortboard, and add at least 1/8" of thickness (more as you go longer) to help get you in early.



It has a lot of rocker for making step drops, a touch of extra thickness through the nose for paddle power, and refined rails to give you control where you need it most, in the barrel.



go with the 5-fin option for maximum versatility.



This board is what you need if you want to go bigger!



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF TECHFLEX or FCS II Mick Fanning Thruster fins in your Next Step.

TANK



After Nathan Florence asked for more foam in his favorite step-up boards we ended up with a beefed up version of the Next Step which Nathan dubbed The Tank.





He rides it once his normal shortboards are too small to handle the waves and just won his first major event the Red Bull Cape Fear paddling his 66 into bombs at Shipsterns Bluff. While most of us have nightmares about that type of wave, it shows that the Tank is a board that can clearly handle whatever you want. It has been ridden around the world and proven by the best surfers in the best heavy water waves, but is also at home in any lineup that demands just a bit more board at your local spot or on your dream surf trip.

The Tank has all the best characteristics of a great step-up-



✪ Extra Volume where you need it most, under your chest, for maximum paddle power that lets you get into waves early and easy, gets you out of the impact-zone faster, and helps make long paddle outs less painful.



✪ Plenty of rocker for a high-performance feeling in larger, more powerful waves. Feels like your shortboard but with extra drive and hold to push as hard as you want. Also helps keep you safe taking late drops and lets you push your limits.



✪ Thinner rails and tail (when compared to the overall thickness) so your beefy board rides with the sensitivity of a thinner board- when you are going fast you dont want boggy, thick rails that slow you down or make it hard to set your bottom turn.



✪ We recommend that you go anywhere from 2" to 10" up from your shortboard, and add at least ¼ to ⅜ " of thickness (more as you go longer). Remember, in bigger waves foam is always your friend.



✪ Comes with 5-fin option so you can configure fins to make the most of different conditions.



We recommend riding your Tank with the Pyzel Futures Fins or Pyzel FCS II's.

MINI PADILLAC



The Mini Padillac is a great step-up for people who want a fast paddling and maneuverable board that is stable and easy to ride.





Its made to get you into waves easily and early, and still fit into a curvy, late drop. Some might even even use it as their everyday board.

We took our proven Padillac, shrunk it down and then redesigned the front half to help it fit into waves that are less than gigantic. When we shrunk it down, the nose ended up feeling pretty wide and the nose rocker felt a bit flat, so we pulled in the nose width and added a bit more nose rocker. The back ½ of the board is the same, but the changes to the forward ½ allow the boards to fit into a curvier wave face and handle later drops with ease.



The Mini Padillac still carries extra volume up under the chest area, but the thickness is hidden away by a nice rolled deck curve and thinned out rails for maximum responsiveness and speed. When you hold it under your arm a 2 ¾ inch thick Mini Padillac feels like a 2 ⅜ inch thick shortboard!



The rocker is a long, continuous curve which helps it ride smooth and consistent without any surprises through big turns. The bottom contour is a gentle Vee with double concave running a light flat Vee through the fins and off the tail. This combo keeps the boards both loose and fast, while further providing stability and drive.



The tail is a swallow, which adds a little extra squirt off your bottom turn and pivot to your top turns. Another big difference from the original Padillac is that the Mini Padillac comes as a 5 fin set-up, allowing you to choose your favorite fin configurations and change them according to the conditions you are surfing in.



Overall you can ride the MP whatever size you want, and I would recommend that you go about ½ to 1 inch wider, and at least ⅜ inch thicker than your daily driver. Foam is your friend, and the Mini Padillac has plenty of it hidden away!



PADILLAC

The Padillac has been ridden to more big wave contest victories than any other single surfboard design in history! John John Florence won the 2016 Eddie at maxing Waimea, Billy Kemper rode them to an unbelievable 4 Jaws wins (and a second place) AND got what is considered the greatest Jaws tube ride so far! Mark Healey gave it the name, and was instrumental in developing and testing the design which he was on when he won the 2014 Billabong XXL Biggest Paddle Award! In the past few years Nathan Florence, JJF, Makua and Koa Rothman, Eli Olson, Billy Kemper, Nic Von Rupp and a bunch of other crazy f@#$ers have put it to the test in the world's biggest waves and they all come back saying it's the best big wave board they have had.





Like the name implies, this board is built to paddle fast and easy, with extra thickness and a fuller outline than most standard guns so you can catch and ride bigger waves with confidence and ease.



It has a clean, flowing rocker, and a light vee bottom with double concaves to give you speed and sensitivity while still maintaining control in heavy conditions. It comes as a quad, for both speed and maneuverability, and can handle anything the ocean throws at you.



Made in sizes between 610 and 10'6, it is a great board for deeper water waves like Sunset, Cloudbreak, Puerto Escondido, Ocean Beach, or anywhere else that gets BIG and HEAVY. It is also a great choice for bigger surfers looking for a controlled, easy feel in all types of waves.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the PADILLAC FIBERGLASS QUAD or FCS II Mick Fanning Thruster fins in your Padillac.





GROM SHADOW



The Grom shadow is a smaller version of the new high-performance shortboard addition to the Ghost family.





Already a favorite of John John Florence, Jack Freestone and the rest of our team, its the board that lets you surf how you want in a wide range of wave conditions and size.

Knowing that the Phantom is a great board for many types of conditions, Jon decided to start with there and redesign it as a more refined, high performance board, while still keeping the added flow and glide that defines the Phantom.



The Shadow is designed to give all surfers the advantages of a wider, forward outlined type of board, but in a sleek, High Performance package.



✪ Modern foil/outline brings improved stability, paddle power, easy speed/flow in weaker waves.



✪ Rocker and bottom contours combine to generate speed and allow tight, powerful turning in all conditions.



✪ Great for all types of waves from beach breaks to points, reefs and even slabs.



✪ Will help Intermediate surfers elevate their performance levels, while also bringing out the best in more advanced surfers.



The Shadow features a high performance outline, the wide point at center not behind as is typical of most other HPSBs. We pulled in the nose by almost a ½ inch and added rocker through the last 12 in the nose to keep it freed up through critical turns.



It has a gentle hip for added sensitivity and looseness, and the squash tail is pulled in a touch to tighten the turning radius and improve vertical surfing capability.



Tail rocker and bottom concave remain similar to the Phantom, already proven to work well in everyday conditions around the world.



The thickness flow sets the Shadow apart from other HPSBs, keeping the volume more forward of center but not overly exaggerated. Added foam under the chest area helps add paddle power and gives extra float under your front foot in slower sections, meaning easy speed and flow.



Ride the Shadow your height to an inch over, in your favorite high performance dimensions.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF XS GROM or FCS II KOLOHE ANDINO GROM fins in your Grom Shadow.





GROM PHANTOM



For groms to make the most out of everyday surf- The Grom Phantom is a daily driver specifically designed in Grom sizes.





The Phantom is the Step-down version of John John Florence's current favorite model the Ghost.



When we first brought out the Ghost we had no idea that its unique design would come to be embraced by so many people in so many different types of waves. However, the one bit of feedback we kept hearing was that it was that it works best in waves shoulder-high and up, so we looked at making a step-down board that would bring that same feel to the head-high and under days that make up most of our daily surf sessions.



The Phantom is a Ghost squashed down, souped up, and with added volume, great for your everyday sessions in less than epic conditions.



We left the same Ghost rocker but added more single concave to flatten it out through the center, helping to create speed and flow without taking away from the overall performance or feel of the original design.



The added width in the tail and nose create a more parallel, fuller outline that helps keep speed up through slower sections and tight turns.



The rails are full but not chunky, giving you more floatation and speed without taking away the sensitivity that we all love in our boards.



Best in waist-high to slightly overhead waves of all types, the Phantom is your daily driver with a high performance edge.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF XS GROM or FCS II KOLOHE ANDINO GROM fins in your Grom Phantom.



GROMLIN

The Gromlin is a great board for both the kid who is just ready to start catching their own waves, or for little rippers who are looking for something different and fun to ride when the surf is less than firing.





Based off the Ghost DNA, it's the Step-Down cousin to the Phantom, with extra volume packed into a shorter, wider, flatter rockered package designed for quick acceleration, easily sustained speed and great paddle power. The Gremlin was made to get you excited about surfing on the days that are less-than-epic, and also to give you a taste of FunFormance that will get you fired up in any kind of surf.



The wider outline is complimented by a low entry rocker for easy speed and glide through the weakest, slowest sections. We left plenty of curve through the tail rocker to keep it performance oriented and add to maneuverability.



The bottom runs from single to double concave, with a nice bit of Vee running of the tail.



This makes it a board that paddles easy, gets up and goes fast, and still has a snappy, drivey, high-performance feel to get you the most out of every wave you catch.



Higher level surfers will want to ride this board as much as 4-6 inches below their height (and find that it actually has a full on high-performance side to it). A more intermediate level surfer will want to stick to something around their height.



It's also a great transitional board for the more beginner surfer who is ready to take the step away from their longboard (or whatever they have been riding) to a more FUNformance design! Whatever length suits you, it is meant to be ridden wider and thicker then your shortboard.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF XS GROM or FCS II KOLOHE ANDINO GROM fins in your GROMlin.

GROM GHOST



For the grom who likes a little bit bigger surf and wants a board to handle that! We took our Ghost model and shrunk it down to give the groms a chance to charge without limitations!

SUPER GROM



Updated for 2023, we have been refining small kids boards ever since we started making them for John John Florence years ago.





This board is designed for total high-performance surfing in all conditions and sizes and made especially to help let kids look more powerful than their weight (or lack of) allows. We have tailored the rocker (a lot of curve), outline and thickness flow to allow groms to get the most out of their surfing while still making it look good.



Not really a beginner's board, if you are looking for help to get to the next level in grom surfing, this board will help elevate your surfing and let you push boundaries.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the JJF XS GROM or FCS II KOLOHE ANDINO GROM fins in your Super Grom 2023.





PINBALL WIZARD



This high performance foil board is designed, tested and loved by Foil Wizards Nathan and John John Florence.





Built with our dual stringer EPS blanks and glassed with Epoxy resin, we use a special Bi-axial cloth on the deck for added strength while still keeping them as light as possible. The dual stringers, coupled with 3" wide carbon tape on the deck and bottom create a very stiff board which helps transfer all of your pumping power directly to your foil without much loss due to flex. Both of fin boxes are also set onto the dual stringers to anchor them to the I-beam created by the stringers/carbon for extra strength and connectivity.

You can also order the Wizard in Darks Arts full carbon for the ultimate strength/weight combo!



The deck is full concave for paddling comfort and natural feeling grip.



The bottom rocker is ultra flat for speedy paddling with kick tail and beveled rails to help with release. We have also added a double concave/deep Vee hull through the front 1/3 to help keep it from "sticking" to the surface when you touch-down mid ride, allowing you to keep your speed up to re-gain flight easily!!



The outline is stubby and full to give you as much foam as possibly in a short little board.



This is now the 5th generation of this design, fine tuned after hours and hours in (and above) the water and feedback from some of the most advanced foiler/surfers in the world.

LOG



Low rocker, full rails, and classic old school single fin outline.





The log is designed to make the smallest waves fun.



Pyzel board agents recommend rocking the FUTURES PERFORMANCE 8" or FCS II CONNECT PG 8" fins in your Log.

PYZALIEN



One of our best loved designs ever! Technically it's a Stubbie, but this board really can take the place of any high-performance shortboard.





It has a single concave running from the nose and under the front foot which blends into double concave and then VEE in the last 6 inches of the tail. This combo gives the board quick speed from take-off and great responsiveness. The outline has a fuller nose and wider tail which keeps the board very fast, while increasing the control and allowing for easier rail to rail transitions at high speed. It has a flat deck and full rails adding to the overall volume, so you should order it 1/8 inch thinner, 3-4 inches shorter and 1/4 to 1/2 inch wider than your shortboard. We know youll love it.



AMIGO



We made the Amigo to fit somewhere right between the Pyzalien and the Flash, as either a chunky shortboard, or a streamlined stubbie.





The heart of this board is a very fast, very user friendly rocker that not only gains speed easily, but has a loose, snappy feel in all kinds of waves.



The outline is full, with a nice hip leading into a wide tailblock which adds to the speed but lets it break free where you want it to. The bottom has single concave running all the way through, with just a touch of double concave between the fins.



This combo gives lift to get the board planing on top of the water easily and helps maintain speed through flatter, weaker sections.



If you love riding a stubbie, but you crave a more high performance feeling, the Amigo is going to be the board for you.

SLAB



John John Florence came up with the idea for this design, and we refined it into his favorite step-down.





We took our JPX, chopped 3 off nose and added some extra tail rocker.

The result is a fuller nose, forward wide point, super high performance board.



The lower nose rocker makes it quick from take off and very drivey down the line. The added tail rocker lets you use all the extra speed for crazy turns, and keeps it ultra loose and free. .



The wider nose and stubby outline make it a super stable board for landing big airs. Order this one about 3 shorter, and 1/4 to 1/2 inch wider than your regular shortboard, same thickness.

JJF SLAB 2.0



The JJF Slab 2.





0 is a new, updated version of our Slab. John John has been riding this design for the past year, and even rode one in the 2015 Quiksilver Pro at Snapper, scoring a 9.23 in weak, slow conditions. After hearing his feedback about wanting something that would work better in those kinds of waves, we took the original Slab and made some significant changes to the bottom contours and rocker. We added a deeper, full concave that starts in the nose and blends into deep double concave through the back 1/3 of the board. We also dropped the tail rocker by a full 1/4 inch and made slight adjustments to the the nose rocker to better suit the forward concave.

The outline is 1/4'' wider in the nose, and just under 1/8' wider through the tail.



All these changes have created a board that has more lift and drive than the original Slab, which allows you to get more speed and flow in even smaller, weaker waves than the original could ideally handle.



With a good amount of volume distributed through the whole length of the board you will want to go 1 to 3 inches shorter, 1/4' to 1/2' wider, and about the same thickness as your good wave shortboard.

SHORTCUT



The ShortCut started as a NextStep, which we chopped 4" off the nose, blending in a nice forward wide-point outline for drive, lowered the entry rocker for good paddling and speed, and left a bit of thickness through the front for flotation.





We also widened up the tail a touch and kept it nice and round so it has a lively feel to it.



You end up with a fast, steady feeling board, but the shorter sizes allow you to draw tight arcs and change your line in the barrel easily.



The solid paddle power lets you get in early, and it will drive down the line. It's especially fast as a quad.



A very versatile board that will surprise you in bigger waves, works well in all kinds of waves and for all levels of surfer. Get the 5-fin for max fun.

SURE THING



The Sure Thing is designed to give you a great blend of Performance and Fun all wrapped up in a full-figured, yet streamlined board that will glide through the weakest surf and still feel snappy and crisp in good surf.





It has a wide, full outline with a subtle double-bump squash reminiscent of a mid 80's shortboard. The nose is full, but not overly so, giving the advantage of lift and drive, while still keeping plenty of curve in the outline. The rocker matches the outline, medium/low all the way through and the bottom has plenty of single concave (more lift and easy speed) running into a gentle Vee off the tail. We put a pair of "Gas Pedal" channels in between the fins in the last 9'' of the tail to add projection and drive while keeping the turning radius tight and easy.



The board has a bit of extra foam under the chest, but we made sure to keep the rail thickness moderate for sensitivity and quick reaction time. The Sure Thing crosses the line between Performance and Fun and actually inspired our new board category "Funformance"- for surfers who want to push their surfing, but also like a little extra to help them out when the surf sucks. This board will not let you down in smaller, weaker waves, but is also super fun on the good days, in good surf too.



Depending on your surfing ability I suggest you ride it 3-5 inches under your "good'' wave shortboard, and about 5/8'' to 3/4'' wider, and 1/16'' to 1/8'' thicker and with about 1-2 liters more volume

SCREAMING EAGLE



The Screaming Eagle is a foil board designed to get you up and flying as fast as possible.





Features that will help:



-Flat rocker for easy, fast paddling



-Concave deck for paddling comfort



-Light, strong XTR/Epoxy construction



-Clean, wide outline for stability and float



-Dual Futures 10" boxes fits 99% of foils



-Carbon top and bottom reduces unwanted flex

VOYAGER 1



For the 2017 World Tour John John Florence knew that he wanted to improve every aspect of his surfing so we started working on a new board that would help him in the smaller/weaker wave end of performance.





He wanted it to work in good surf, but carry more speed and flow when the waves were weaker and less curvy. After a lot of testing and fine-tuning we ended up with the board that had all the right ingredients. John named it Voyager 1 after the NASA spacecraft launched in 1977 for Interstellar exploration. He then got together with his friend J.P. Olson and designed the logo.

If you are looking for all the best elements of high performance surfing in everyday surf conditions and all kinds of waves, Voyager 1 is the board for you.



The rocker is flatter through the entry and under the front foot to add speed, flow and drive, while the tail has a touch of extra bend in the last 6 inches to make it loose and sensitive.



The outline is clean, and compliments the rocker with a hip that helps to add a little squirt and creates a pivot point through snappy turns.



It has a simple single concave through the whole bottom which helps get the board on top of the water and keeps its speed up in weaker surf. The fuller, soft rails help to balance out the effects of the concave and keep it from feeling to catchy and less likely to dig rail.



Voyager 1 is now an important part of JJFs quiver and one of his favorite boards. Ride it same in same dims as your other shortboards, or go an inch shorter and a touch wider for smaller waves.





BASTARD



The most High Performance design in our range, The Bastard is the board that John John Florence rides in most conditions and comps all around the world (in 2016 he finished 1st in Rio, Portugal, and Haleiwa and won the World Title mostly riding his favorite Bastards).





Michel Bourez also won the 2016 Pipe Masters on a Firewire LFT version of The Bastard.



Good in beach break, reefs and points, this is a very versatile board that has quite a bit of continuous rocker for a snappy, loose feel, but still has a lot of drive in good waves. Single concave throughout adds lift and more speed.



The outline features a tail that is slightly pulled in, giving bite and drive through turns, a subtle hip that also makes it easy to redirect and we flattened out the deck to re-position the volume for a lively feel.



Not recommended for beginners, the Bastard is a great board for everyday sessions in waves with at least a little curve in the face and some push to them, and it really comes alive in powerful, juicy conditions

INDIE GROM



The Indie Grom is designed for the everyday Grom surfer.





In terms of high-performance shapes, this board is also very user-friendly. We toned down the concave and rocker, keeping it fast but adding to its stability.



The clean, smooth outline makes it consistent and flowing through turns. We make this model a bit thicker in the middle for maximum wave catching, but keep the rails and tips thinner so it still responds to the lighter surfers when engaging turns.



Our thinking on this one is to get the Groms into waves easier, while still allowing for high-performance surfing. It's simple: if you're not catching waves, you're not having fun!

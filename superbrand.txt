THE FLING



RIDE EVERYTHING

The Fling is the world’s best variable performance fish in our opinion. “It makes small and average feel like head high and glassy”and “It brought my love of surfing back to life”are the most common feedback we hear. Designed as a shorter and more modern/high performance take on the keel fin fish. It’s young, rad, and classy all at the same time. It’s crazy fast down the line, smooth and tight through carves, and progressive in the pocket. It’s versatile and can be surfed assertively off the tail, or with light feet for those that love airs. Choose the Original tail for the Original Fling experience or go with the hip squash tail for a more pivoty, top to bottom feeling, or the wing swallow for the best of both. 



ABOUT SUPERFLEX:

Game Changing Feel, Developed by Superbrand: Instead of relying on a wood stringer, SUPERflex uses a lively, medium density, stringer-less EPS core. Wrapping this: 4 different types of reinforcements going in 6 different directions so that all the flex and strength is engineered into the surface of the board. The result is a consistent feel tip to tail, rail to rail and allows the board to flex naturally with the contours of the wave and in response to applied pressure from the surfer, all while creating a spring back feeling when coming out of turns. SUPERflex is a standard upgrade option on the FLING collection and is available for custom order on all other models.



Please note due to unprecedented demand, all boards are built to order with wait times approx 4 -5 weeks.. Epoxy boards approx 4-6 weeks.



SERIAL KEELER 2023



TWINS ARE MORE FUN

The Serial Keeler is a brand-new twin fin inspired by the surf in our global back yards, the softer points and back beaches of the Australian East Coast as well as the reefs and beach breaks of San Diego county. Inspired by the regional, traditional fish shapes, this Keel fin twin draws on everything we love about the traditional fishes and blends that with the performance our riders and athletes demand. This board loves to go fast! It projects off the bottom and holds solid through hard rail carves. Draw dreamy lines on the face or float the tail through the lip with ease. We recommend you ride this board with either the Futures K2 Keels or the FCS 2 performance keel fins for best results.

PIGDOG TWIN



TWIN FIN RADNESS

The Original Pig Dog (First Released in 2010), with its curvy outline, wide nose, and pulled in tail make it a perfect fit for pulling in under the lip or taking off deep. 



The Pigdog Twin was the result of some conversations between the collective as to how the shape might work as a pure twin. With the wider "dad" dimensions to give the board a wider versatility, and the fin position changed to suit a larger upright fin (such as the FCS Power Twin or the Futures EN) to give hold and control with tons of drive and speed, the pigdog twin was born and has been blowing minds ever since. If you are looking to spice up your surfing with a versatile, fun board that can be surfed as hard or as easy as you like - look no further.

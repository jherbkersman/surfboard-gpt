At the bottom of this prompt are the descriptions from every surfboard model on ajwsurfboards, a custom surfboard manufacturer.
I want you to act as the owner and shaper of ajwsurfboards and help make recommendations on which board and size that customers chatting with you should order.
Try to collect information about the customer like their weight, height, age, surfing skill level, and wave type (although not every single one of those components is necessary to make a recommendation).
It is generally better to recommend two or three boards for a customer to choose from and then explain why they might prefer one over the other, than just recommend a single model (unless the user gives lots of information about their situation and you are very confident that there is one specific model that will work very well for them.)
It is good to recommend dimensions for users to choose from in the form of a range of measurements instead of exact numbers. If a user is asking for a surfboard volume recommendation, it is better to slightly overestimate a recommendation for them by 0.5 to 1 liter than to recommend a board that is too small.
Please keep your responses concise and do not overwhelm the customer with too much information about the boards.
Do not give overly confident answers when you are not confident in the accuracy of your statements.
Do not give overly general information about surfboards, but give specific details on your brand's models, which are all listed with detailed descriptions below:

INDIVIDUAL BOARD DETAILS:

BLACK MAGIC

The Black Magic is all about get up and go speed in weak, gutless surf. The ultimate small wave machine. 
It features an extra wide tail block for surface area combined with an optional 4 channels for extra drive and speed with an overall lower to medium entry rocker exiting with a lower to medium tail rocker. All focus being on Speed.
Regarding dimensions: we recommend ride it  1-2” shorter  1/2”- 3/4” wider and 1/8” thinner or the same thickness as your regular shortboard.
It features a double concave Deck with meaty chimed rails creating a very full deck feeling that paddles well.
If you want to ride this board extra short, it can work, just order some extra thickness to compensate for any length lost. All depending on how small of waves you prefer.
It does perform well for turns and speed in gutless surf.



X-STUMP

A shorter squattier verison of the X-Series. w/ lower entry rocker a fuller nose and wide point a hair foward. deep single concve nose to flat tail. creating a very fast and skatey small wave board. Order 4-6" shorter than normal shortboard and 3/4 to an inch wider.



ARROW HEAD

This is the exact design a few certain guys we know have been flipping out over… Literally!!! A tiny wave contest machine… with tons of hidden volume this thing flies in nothing and extremely responsive in weak waves…We took the same bottom curve an concaves from the StepRail PL3 which worked so well and basically added that same board concept to a older winged swallow… put a little notchtail just for fun… The feedback has been amazing! … super easy to get going in nothing! Minor adjustments for extra drive in 2015!

Ride 1″shorter than your regular shortboard and 1/2″ wider same thickness or hair thinner



THEANSWER

The Answer model is our longest standing shortboard design proven over the years! This design has won more contests, and prize money than any other model over the years… Still a go to in the quiver of every team guy we work with… Just a fast and safe board to rip in small fast beach breaks!

Ride 1-2″ shorter + 1/4″ wider + 1/16″ thinner than standard shortboard



FULLNOSE FISH II

Designed for those small days when you just want to get wet. There is nothing Retro about this Full Nose Fish. For a squatty board it is actually quite rippable w/ a modern day rail line. A must for every complete quiver! Go short+Wide!! Optional 5fin setup. Originally this design was offered with No wing, however we’ve had many requests and preferred to shaping in the added single wing in the outline by for some extra responsiveness… It does come with a WING now, however if one requests we can still shape it without a wing if one wants that extra shorter squattier fish.

We’ve added a touch of hidden foam for extra paddle power and just a FUN all around Fish for all conditions… Whenever your in a rut in ur surfing… just order a fish guaranteed to get you stoked on enjoying the ocean again!!!

Ride 4-6″ shorter + 7/8″ – 1 & 1/8 wider than standard shortboard



STEPRAIL PL3

we are VERY excited about this board! If you liked the PL2 for average waves… this is the stepDown from that… GEARED SPECIFICALLY for knee high waves… Will work up to chest high, as well as some barrels… but compared to the other PotatoLaunchers this is a unique board in its own right… More of a fish/ AIR board for tiny surf… Not as versatile once the waves get larger. It has the most hidden foam of any design we offer. VERY full rails w/ an EXTREME STEPrail in the tail of the board creating a very small rail line w/ a very full tail… Allowing it to FLY in the tiniest waves!!! One of the fastest small wave boards we’ve ever made… So fun in gutless surf!!!

Ride 3-6″ shorter + ¾” – 1½” Wider



GUY SHORTBO

This particular model features a very "80’s" outline mixed with the foil and rail shape that of a modern day curve. Works best w/ a very full diamond tail / pluggy R.tails are fun too! All around lower rocker curves w/ a pretty exaggerated rail lift in the back near the fins allows for a super-fun board you can do circles on, also designed to fit in the barrel. Subtle Single concave all the way thru the tail. Order 4-6" shorter & 1/2" – 1 & 1/8" wider than your normal shortboard. Optional 5fin set up as well as a break nose for the interested in float + Skate

Ride 4-6″ shorter + 7/8″ wider than standard shortboard



Classic’Twinfin’fish

Classic “Twin” w/ a slightly pulled in tail + a dash of extra belly rocker to be ridden more critical than your standard older keel fin fishes. More info coming soon….



CAMS PRO-MODEL

The biggest adjustment for this design in 2015 has been a slightly lower nose rocker w/ more curve and concaves in the fin area for more radical surfing. Its a blend between the rockers of the HungryMan an template of the Mr.Clean. CamRichards has been ripping harder this year than ever, and his feedback has honestly never been so positive… we fine tune the designs over and over, and very pleased w/ this years result… Order yours HydroflexEpoxy vacuum bagged on a regular poly blank the liveliness truly is incredible! Feel the difference!



MRCLEAN

Features the lowest nose entry offered, which allows the board to paddle and accelerate with ease. Overall, a very clean rocker and outline for a very nice flow while bottom turning and holding a line through the flats. The secret to this board’s success is an exaggerated flip behind the rear fin, which allows release and responsiveness in the lip, very popular for fin throws or above the lip antics. Ride 1″ smaller than your regular shortboard.

Ride 1″ smaller than your regular shortboard



POTATOLAUNCHER II

This is still our best selling design!!! A guaranteed safe an fun board for everyone!!! wide enough for everyday mush waves… yet still has the rocker curves and fin placement as the Original PotatoLauncher and can still sideslip into some throaty barrels… the proof is in the pudding. Its amazing how many happy customers have reordered this design year after year! We appreciate all the feedback!

Ride 3-5″ shorter + 3/4″- 1″ Wider



ALLIGATOR ARMS

Feel like you have Alligator Arms and you cant dig deep enough??? this little badboy will give u the little extra glide and speed that you need… This goes along w/our 1board quiver concept; a very low all around rocker w/ extra foam in the chest for paddling. Still maneuverable and forgiving just a great all arounder that we’ve made for a few of the custom guys and feedback has been overwhelmingly fantastic! Fast and easy to control ride as a quad or thruster sorta a shortboard version of the PL2.0



SCREAMER

Hungry Man has been so popular w/ every team guy we’ve done… We wanted to make a smaller version of it. The “Screamer” is basically the Hungry Man w/ extra 1/4″ wider. Do to the extreme concave and parallel outline, we needed to add some vee out the back releasing the flatter tail rocker and creating a very carvy and drivey board. you’ll be screaming for more!!!

Ride 2″ shorter + 1/4″ wider than HungryMan or standard shortboard



HUNGRY MAN

U ever eat those HungryMan microwave dinners for 5.99…? Ur disappointed with urself as soon as u walk out the store. This REALLY isn’t what u wanted? However u cant fight the hunger! U eat it anyway. Now u gotta admit.. that first bite really, is surprisingly Fantastic! By the end of meal ur FULL, Happy, and really cant find anything to complain about. Heres where we got the name. We took a bad machine cut & spent all night reshaping it. Buckly had rush ordered a 5’11 board "Lets just say he got the reshaped board due to time constraints.." Surprisingly he said.. Best board I’ve had in years! even though he didn’t want it at first. Features deep single thru whole board. Increased nose lift, lower tail area for speed. w/a nice small rail in front of the fins GET ONE YOU’LL LOVE IT!!!!

Ride same to 1″ shoter + 1/8 wider + 1/8 thicker than normal shortboard



"SPEEDY" GONZALEZ

Description

-High Performance all arounder…. Features a slightly flatter tail rocker than some of our other performance boards which gives it immediate Speed/ Drive on the take off which out have to generate down the line speed… Do the flatter tail curve, we moved the widepoint back+ tucked the rail slightly farther back onto the rail which gives a very forgiving rail transition… Easy to manuever and switch rail to rail quite smoothly… Overall feedback is Fast and easy to carve crisp fast turns maintaining speed thru the whole wave. A great 4ft- 6ft beachbreak board top to bottom style surfing. Surf Fast on the SPEEDY model!



ACID CAT 

Basically –  this design originated from “STAB” magazines very 1st airshow at the WACO wave pool… They invited all the Best ‘Aerial’ surfers from around the World to showcase who could land the Craziest maneuver on a Surfboard…

1 of those invitees was Matt Meola of Maui, Hawaii.  At the time we had never met nor shaped him a board… yet he ordered 3 boards as he was going to test a batch of different shapers boards at the pool prior to the event.  HIS only requests: NEEDS to  GO FAST + Extra POP, while hopefully stable enough to recover smoothly.

What we came up w/was a 5’5″ slightly flatter semi fuller  nose for a shortboard was a twist of our Xstump. increased the volume on the front foot for stability and a dropped the tail rocker more similar to a fish rocker below 2″… added soft forgiving rails combined w/ deeper concaves…

VERY 1st session attempting board Matt landed what some are calling one of  the craziest airs to date doing a full backside ‘McTwist FLIP’ later Nominated for

 SURFER POLL Awards “Manuever of the YEAR” 

Not only is the board extremely forgiving for guys attempting crazy AIRs it is primarily a good DAILY Driver fun  in everyday beach breaks she paddles well easy to get speed and just stable forgiving to surf.   If u like SPEED and going for a big section this is the board for you!  Works best when ordered 3-4″ shorter and 1/2″ wider than regular shortboard.  Have FUN go BIG!

“STAB magazine TOP5 boards for 2019 “



BACK2FUTURE:

An 80’s Hybrid with modern performance features such as lower volume tail and rail line. 
This design is a fun playback to the flat deck slight beak nose volume plus boards of the 80s.
Features a medium entry nose rocker with plenty of vee for easy tail to tail transitions.
Exiting with one of the lower tail rocker designs we offer making it Mega Fast!
Deck is flat with a chimed front end blending to a lower volume rail and tail for control and responsiveness.
Not your old 80’s remake. Similar positive easy to surf features with a touch of modern in the business end of the board.
Works best as a Thruster or even as a 2+1 fin setup.
Good for smaller everyday surf but due to paddle power and vee bottom it can also work well in larger surf and tube riding.
Ride 2-3” shorter than your normal shortboard and 1/4”-3/4” wider same thickness or even 1/8” thinner.



OG POTATO LAUNCHER

An absolute barrel machine!!! This little thing has given me more joy in the last year, than any model I’ve ever had. Probably the most versatile board we offer… Depending on surfing ability? this can be ridden anything from 3ft – 15ft. She features a fuller nose w/ pulled narrow R.tail.. Double hollow vee bottom for steep fluid drops. Works 100% best as a quad, however we feature it w/ the 5 fin option for those that are stuck on thruster.

Update: This board has withstood the test of time… still my personal favorite board to shape. Have had sooo many customers comeback from Indo or wherever saying they got the best barrel of they’re life on this board… Heres the original made for RobBrown… We’ve made adjustments but keep going back to the Original for Pumping barrels… She’s a GEM for any quiver!!!!

(Thick beak-nose optional for a retro feel)

Ride 3-5″ shorter + 3/4″- 7/8″ wider than standard shortboard. Order a hair narrow and thicker for gunny feel. Order wider and thinner for waves under head high



MISSING LINK

The "Missing link" is the evil twin to the Potato Launcher… Even though we Love the P.L. so much there, obviously are a few limitations w/ such a full nose and outline when it come to high-performance surfing… The Missing Link blends that gaps. Featuring the same bottom contours + tail rocker as the P.L. we dropped the rail a bit thinner, added a few inches and put the "Answer" nose to the outline. The result is a shortboard w/ secret of hidden foam. Mostly to be ridden when ur local beach break is maxing.

Ride 1-2″ shorter + 1/4″- 1/2″ wider than standard shortboard



BLACK PELICAN

Your bones getting older, had a few extra beers, your hair getting thinner but your boards are getting thicker but on good days you can still swoop down and take a few bombs from the pack, then you need to be on the “Black Pelican” The black pelican sits on logs he doesn’t ride them. High performance short boards just super sized like an extra combo meal for the guy who needs a little more but still has his days when it counts

Designed to be a friendly paddler, rember it has plenty of hidden meet



STEP UP

Designed for extra bite and drive when it counts. Ideal for glassy and hollow conditions. These are specialized for specialized waves. its important to have the right board for when the surf is FINALLY pumping. This will get the job done!

MOTHER TRUCKER



OUR MOTHER TRUCKER GUN HAS BEEN BUILT TO TAKE ON THE BIGGEST AND BEST WAVES THAT YOU CAN PADDLE INTO. EXTRA PADDLE POWER, STABILITY AND DRIVE EQUALS EXTRA CONFIDENCE – AND THAT’S WHAT THE MOTHER TRUCKER DELIVERS IN SPADES.

Its medium + continuous rocker is perfectly suited to powerful waves. The entry point is high enough to prevent any catch on the front edge, and provides more control in critical conditions. Plenty of volume is packed into the centre of the board, yet relatively low rails allow you to turn at serious speed. A light vee bottom from nose to tail with double concave through the fins maintains allows for quick turning and control.

STEP OFF

Whether there’s no one else around and you just want to triple your wave count, or it’s a wave that requires a ski for access, this is the exact board we’ve refined to use for step offs. Our team riders, ambassadors and friends have requested it more and more in the last two years, and after constant refining, we’re making it available for custom order.



Its rocker is very close to the FMNII, with a medium entry and exit curve designed to fit in quality, hollow waves. But the similarities end there. The Step Off’s outline is narrow and straight, for incredible speed down the line and extra hold. This is designed to help you fit into the barrel easier, withstanding shockwaves, chandeliers or whatever else is thrown your way.



The concave is a shallow single throughout, as the Step Off is designed to harness the power of the waves you’ll be surfing and maximise control, rather than generate any unnecessary lift. Recommended glassing is 6x6x6 (two layers of 6 ounce on the deck and one layer on the bottom). This of course provides plenty of strength and durability, but also gives extra momentum that you want in powerful, bumpy, or windy conditions.



We also recommend a smaller fin than usual – so if you’d normally ride a large template, go with a medium in your Step Off. This is due to all the hold coming from the outline, which is best complemented by smaller fins to hit max speed and retain some manoeuvrability. During R&D, fin set ups have varied between quad just for tubes, or thruster if you’re likely to be turning as well.



Compared to your regular shortboard, like the Monsta 2020, ride the Step Off 1/4” to 5/16” thinner and 1” to 1 3/8” narrower.

FORGET ME NOT 3 STEP UP



Our Forget Me Not 3 Step Up is designed for those days we dream about. It’s all about harnessing the speed of good quality, bigger waves, and having equipment you can rely on to perform and push the limits.



In the last few seasons it has excelled on countless surf trips and at the more powerful locations on the WCT, ridden by the entire Traktor Team if they feel the surf calls for at least an inch longer than their regular shortboard.



When Ace won the Tahiti Pro in perfect double overhead Teahupo’o, he chose a slightly longer version of his regular 5’10” Forget Me Not, and rode a FMN3 Step Up 6’0” to victory. There’s been a long list of highlights during our development of the FMN3 Step Up.

FORGET ME NOT 3



THE PINNACLE OF HIGH PERFORMANCE.

The Forget Me Not 3 has been fine tuned for the waves we all dream about. Whether it’s head high with perfect shape, or solid tubes, it’s our most refined model for unlimited performance in all hollow conditions. For over a decade now, the DNA of this board has excelled on countless surf trips and each of the best quality locations on the Championship Tour. From Parko and Julian becoming Pipe Masters and Triple Crown champions, to Dusty winning at Haleiwa, Owen dominating at Cloudbreak (including two perfect 20 point heats along the way), and Jeremy, Ace and Julian all taking top honours at Teahupo’o.



To maximise confidence in all of these conditions, the FMN3 has slightly more curve than the Monsta, while also implementing a subtle single to double concave, which means the board will harness all the wave’s power and give you maximum control. Compared to previous FMN models, we’ve lowered the rails slightly to prompt intuitive turns at high speed. This is in line with other modern team favourites like the Schooner, with the overall foil keeping more foam hidden in the middle of the board, pulling down to a fractionally more refined rail line.



Every FMN3 round pin comes standard with a 5 fin set up so you can ride it as a thruster for a mix of tubes and turns, or a quad if you are just hunting barrels.

MONSTA 10



EVOLUTION OF THE BEST - OUR 10TH EDITION.

The all new Monsta, ready for anything in 2023 and beyond. To be in line with the Traktor Team’s most recent favourite boards, we’ve made some slight adjustments to the foil along with fractionally deeper concaves to provide extra lift and quicker transitions.



The rocker is still the same magic curve as our Monsta 20, featuring a generous sweet spot which easily generates speed, allows you to control big turns, and balances release out of the lip. The nose has just enough flip in the last few inches to prevent catching in critical parts of the wave, while the tail rocker remains to fit into the waves our Monsta is designed to thrive in – almost any conditions from chest high to double overhead.



Single concave under front foot runs into a double concave through the fins to give you plenty of spark, yet maintain control in powerful surf, while a clean outline flows into a slight hip that allows for responsive direction changes. Overall, the Monsta prompts intuitive & fast surfing. It’s our best flagship shortboard yet, and now, it’s ready for the rest of the world to enjoy anywhere, anytime. The best always find a way to get better.

MONSTA 10 EASY RIDER



Easy Rider dimensions have been created with the goal of making our most popular models even more approachable. After a year of JS riding more different boards than ever before alongside Occy and Parko, with an R&D process riddled with injuries, lower fitness levels & work obligations, JS designed our EasyRider specs for easy paddling coupled with high performance surfing. Foam is hidden in all the right places for extra floatation, but with lowered rails that can still be buried at high speed.



The all new Monsta, ready for anything in 2023 and beyond. To be in line with the Traktor Team’s most recent favourite boards, we’ve made some slight adjustments to the foil along with fractionally deeper concaves to provide extra lift and quicker transitions.

EL BARON



El Barón’s development takes the Big Baron’s momentum and fine tuning a few overwhelmingly popular requests to create a new performance mid length.



The head honcho of the Baron family – the El Barón features a stretched out Big Baron outline that’s ridden narrower, with slightly more rocker and modern concaves to handle more speed and versatility. It’s a subtle single to double, featuring a “reverse concave” – one of Jason’s favourite designs. This means it’s a deeper concave in the middle, with slightly shallower concave in the nose and tail to help with water flow for maximum drive. Similar to the Big Baron, riding El Barón will naturally smooth out your surfing and translate almost immediately to the shorter, more high-performance boards that most of us want to ride when conditions (and mood) align.



El Barón gives you plenty of options, while not requiring a lot in return when it comes to wave quality, fitness or ability. You’ll have extra time to set up and make adjustments, earlier and easier entry as you paddle in, and the ability to go further and stay out longer in whatever waves are on offer.



Recommended fin choice:

Futures Boxes - JS Thruster Fin

FCS II - FCS II JS Tri or Quad.



TEAM RIDER REFERENCE

The vast majority of surfers could ride almost any of the El Barón's stock dimensions. Start with a couple more liters than your regular board, then go as big as you like depending on the style of waves and surfing you’re intending. For example, someone with a longboard background might just step down to a 7’0” or 7’6”, while a surfer who only rides shortboards might go no longer than a 6’4” to retain plenty of maneuverability.



HARRISON ROACH Height: 5’10” (177 cm) // Weight: 72 kg - 158 lbs

*Rides 6'4 ” x 19 3/4” x 2 1/2” = 34.4L



*Rides 7’6” x 21 1/2” x 2 7/8” x 51.8L



SCHOONER

The latest and greatest in our long line of world class all-rounders, the Schooner is a high-volume performance board. Why did Mikey want to call it the Schooner? The wide point has been pushed forward, so more of the foam is at the top... Like a beer. Mikey loves beer and so do we, but the science doesn’t stop there. Like any good beverage you don’t want it too flat either – this is a performance-oriented sled after all.



A medium curve, close to the Monsta rocker, prevents catching in critical parts of the wave, and provides the ideal balance between generating speed and maintaining control during explosive manoeuvres. This is complemented by a fuller outline, close to the Raging Bull, with a similar foil maintaining thickness in the middle, but relatively low rails. Just like our EasyRider range, this lets you ride a thicker board than usual (approx. 1/8”). Aim for slightly over your regular volume, but an inch shorter than standard shortboards. So for example, if your regular Monsta is 6’0” x 18 3/4” x 2 5/16” x 27.5L, then your Schooner will be 5’11” x 18 7/8” x 2 1/2 x 28.7L.



Mikey’s done his favourite R&D in Aussie slabs, running point breaks, and heavy tubes all throughout Europe. Julian’s ridden the Schooner in some of the biggest & best quality waves of the year around home, then also used the same board to throw huge airs when it’s three foot. Conner surfed the Schooner in a variety of dimensions throughout the Hawaiian winter, from the smallest days of the season to solid Sunset – packing all the volume of a regular 6’4” into a 6’2”. And to top it off, Kauli claimed his latest batch of Schooners to be the best board ever for getting barrelled at Teahupo’o.



The Schooner is built to excel in a huge variety of waves, from head high to as big as you want to take it.

XERO GRAVITY



Xero Gravity is the next in line of our favourite fusions ever. Ridden the same dimensions as your Monsta Box, with the same magic rocker, this will be your all-rounder even more geared to high performance surfing than the updated Xero, which in comparison has the slightly flatter Blak Box rocker and a fuller outline. Xero Gravity also features a similar foil to the previous Xero, with foam hidden in the deck, but a slightly pulled down rail that’s fine tuned for manoeuvrability & quick response.



We’ve streamlined the range while keeping all the nuance and specialised qualities you want to have a board model for every type of wave. Want a super groveller? That’s the Sub Xero. A more performance-oriented option to handle flatter conditions? That’s the new Xero, now even closer to your original Blak Box. And for a performance all-rounder – that’s right here, the Xero Gravity.



It’s our direct update on the board that won QS and CT events in the type of conditions we all surf every day. And it was voted the Australian board of the year back-to-back, due to overdelivering in countless sessions for regular surfers in average to pumping waves. If the Monsta Box made you enjoy surfing more, Xero Gravity will send you to the moon.

RAGING BULL



Over the last year, Occy’s fallen back in love with surfing all over again. He’s in the water more, working on boards constantly with JS, and revisiting all of his old favourites to combine the best of the last decade with our next golden era… Right now.



The Raging Bull is an incredibly forgiving, versatile travel board that will be your go-to for better days at home and any time you’re lucky enough to be away chasing proper waves. It has all of the elements Occ wanted to make performance surfing easy. User-friendly, but with the ability to handle heavier conditions and powerful surfers. Compared with our other models built for quality surf, there’s a lot of differences here. A fuller nose with the wide point and extra thickness pushed forward combine with a flatter entry rocker to make it paddle fast and get into waves early, and then while surfing, generate and hold all of that extra speed.



A pulled-in tail gives you control for turns and barrels in more critical conditions, while a touch more curve in the exit rocker adds manoeuvrability and release out of the lip. Moderate single concave starts under front foot, moving to double just before the fins to provide lift and more intuitive rail-to-rail transitions. Then finally, there’s Occ’s favourite part – as he calls it, the “Raging Bull thickness”. Essentially, this refers to JS maintaining a strategically generous distribution of volume throughout the board that goes hand in hand with thicker stock dimensions. This is the key to more paddle power, gliding over flat sections, and to again quote Occ, “lets you leave it on rail forever.”



The Raging Bull makes your best surfing easy from home to hard core surf trips, and it’s an easy decision to make if you’re only going to have one go-to board with you. As we saw from Occy at Bells, that’s all it takes to make the fire burn brighter than ever. The Raging Bull is back.

RAGING BULL CHANNEL BOTTOM



Occy’s quiver for the 2023 Bells Beach heritage heat featured several Raging Bull channel bottoms, and in a throwback to his infamous battles with Tom Curren, he rode one to get a close win over his long term rival that saw both legends deliver a masterclass in pure rail surfing. Even in solid, onshore Bells Bowl everyone from the WSL commentators to Parko made the call that Occ was still coming off the bottom harder than any of the current day CT surfers. Especially as he delivered another edition of that turn.



To celebrate timeless surfing like this, we’ve decided to build a limited edition run of replica Raging Bull channel bottoms.



Of course, Occy is the original Raging Bull, so he’ll ride a channel bottom in any powerful wave to take advantage of the extra speed, drive and hold. But for the majority of surfers out there, we’d recommend riding your channel bottom in quality, clean conditions – if the waves have plenty of power then you’ll experience that increased speed, drive and hold exactly when you want it.



Please note, due to the channels, the only fin plugs available are FCS1. Suggested fins are the limited edition FCS1 x JS Arc Fin template available both online here and at your local core store.

BULLSEYE

MORE FOAM, MORE FUN

Occy’s new step down, the Bullseye, accentuates all of the small wave features the Raging Bull already has in spades. Ridden 2-3 inches shorter and wider than its big brother, the Bullseye is built to keep you catching a lot of waves and flying down the line when other boards would be struggling.



You’ll enjoy most of the same key design features as the Raging Bull throughout, with its wide point pushed forward and even more foam redistributed under your chest / front foot. Complemented by a flatter entry rocker, these elements work together to get you valuable paddle power and instant acceleration up to wave speed.



Unique to the Bullseye however is a slight vee in the nose, a forgiving addition that lifts the forward rails out of the water in steeper sections and helps to initiate turns with less effort – especially useful in weaker surf. This moves to a moderate single to double concave for extra lift and easy rail-to-rail transitions. Similar to the Raging Bull, the Bullseye’s pulled-in tail and slight curve in the exit rocker lets you hit sections hard whenever possible.



The Bullseye has been fine tuned for Occ since he’s retired (mostly) from competing, but not from surfing. It’s versatile and user-friendly enough to be a daily motivation if you want to be in the water more than ever, keeping you sharp to surf your best, and then jump on a Raging Bull for pumping waves without missing a beat.

XERO

OUR NEW GOLD STANDARD ALL-ROUNDER

We experiment with designs constantly, but JS only commits to a new board model when there’s an obvious quantum leap in performance. That’s the Xero.



Our new gold standard of all-rounders, the Xero came together by fusing elements of the most popular current models together, just like the Monsta Box. JS focussed on the strengths of our three clear global favourites over the past decade, and tested combinations along with fresh ideas endlessly alongside the Traktor Team to find the ultimate everyday shortboard. Built to blow minds in all conditions – especially weaker, flatter faced waves.



Where did we land? On the Blak Box rocker, Monsta Box rail & concaves, with a Monsta outline. Incredibly fast, this rocker fits into a huge range of waves, and provides even more drive than the Monsta Box. It’s flat enough to fly in anything but has just enough curve to be pushed hard when combined with the Monsta’s clean, performance outline, which flows into a slight hip that provides intuitive, instant direction changes. And similar to the Monsta Box, single concave under front foot runs into a double through the fins to give you extra lift yet maintain control in more critical sections.



We recommend riding the same dimensions as your Monsta Box 2020, or in EasyRider dims, closer to your Blak Box 3.

XERO EASY RIDER



Easy rider dimensions created with the goal of making our most popular models even more approachable. After a year of JS riding more different boards than ever before alongside Occy and Parko, with an R&D process riddled with injuries, lower fitness levels & work obligations, JS designed our EasyRider specs for easy paddling coupled with high performance surfing. Foam is hidden in all the right places for extra floatation, but with lowered rails that can still be buried at high speed.

BLACK BARON 2.1



THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, TWIN + STABILISER.

We loved the Black Baron so much it’s been ridden in every type of wave, so version 2.1 is all about taking the strengths of our first ever twin fin and giving it a wider range of conditions. Like a new fighter jet with a comfortable cruising speed you’re used to maxing out at, the Black Baron 2.1 brings the best parts of twin fin flow to even higher quality waves and faster surfing. Like the original it’s equal parts old school speed and new school flair - foam in all the right places to float over soft sections and fly down the line, yet still allow you to lay it on rail or bust the fins even when you’re going Mach 10.



Where the changes begin are in the outline – it’s a stretched out Black Baron, ridden 2 inches longer. We’ve also increased the rocker a touch, and added modern concaves to handle more speed and versatility. It’s a subtle single to double, featuring a “reverse concave” – one of Jason’s favourite designs.



This means it’s a deeper concave in the middle, with slightly shallower concave in the nose and tail to help with water flow for maximum drive. Black Baron 2.1 is the new all-rounder of twin fins. We’ve just added the rear stabiliser and to quote JS, this twin is an EasyRidin’, super gliding twin fin to use in everything from 2ft to 5ft. Featuring a Schooner type foil and rail, so ride it 1/8” thicker and remember approx. 2 inches longer than your Black Baron. Whatever way you go, it’s still all about maximum fun.

BIG BARON



PE CONSTRUCTION.

An instant classic, the Big Baron is inspired by the mid lengths that generations before us rode on the infamous Gold Coast points. This is paired with a more modern bottom contour and twin fin placement, then complemented by a neatly pulled in round tail for extra hold. Because on this board, you’ll be burning speed and burying rail. A lot of it.



An overall flat rocker generates and holds momentum in even the weakest conditions, while vee throughout the board from nose to tail with added double concave through the fins helps it rock from rail to rail and retain its manoeuvrability. The plan shape holds a generous distribution of volume throughout, with relatively low rails allowing you to still turn at high speed. The Big Baron excels in playful conditions from knee high to slightly overhead. And while short, sharp waves are not where its range of strengths are best used, it has the paddle power and ability to control speed that you’ll love in quality, longer waves. On points, reefs, or beach breaks with stretched out banks, the Big Baron takes the pressure off and lets you enjoy the downtime between turns, tubes or the typical sections other boards can get stuck chasing. And as a bonus, riding the Big Baron will naturally smooth out your surfing and translate almost immediately to the shorter, more high-performance boards that most of us want to ride when conditions (and mood) align. The Big Baron is designed to give a lot and only require a little in return. More time to set up and make adjustments, earlier and easier entry as you paddle in, and the ability to go further and stay out longer in whatever waves are on offer.



*Recommended fin choice – JS Twin Fin for Futures or FCSII Power Twin template (both pictured).



TEAM RIDER REFERENCE

The vast majority of surfers could ride almost any of the Big Baron’s stock dimensions. Start with a couple more liters than your regular board, then go as big as you like depending on the style of waves and surfing you’re intending. For example, someone with a longboard background might just step down to a 7’0” or 7’6”, while a surfer who only rides shortboards might go no longer than a 6’4” to retain plenty of maneuverability. And as you can see from Jason’s tech talk, Harry has done both to great effect depending on conditions and the approach he’s aiming for.

SUB XERO



THE FASTEST BOARD FOR SLOW WAVES.

This is everything you want in small surf. To create the Sub Xero, we combined the new Xero with our long running summer favourite, the Psycho Nitro. It has the Nitro’s ultra-fast low to flat rocker and full outline, but with the nose pulled in a touch, and a wider, straighter tail.



In the engine room, vee in the nose prompts quick rail to rail transitions, moving into a deeper single to double concave, which helps the Sub Xero to hold speed and change directions with minimal energy. Generous thickness & a flatter deck is complemented by slightly pulled down rails, similar to other boards with EasyRider style dimensions. This helps maintain volume throughout, while also making it easy to initiate turns and provide immediate response to hit any section on offer.



It’s designed to be as performance oriented as you could possibly ride in knee high waves, and we couldn’t be more excited to unveil it for those days you wouldn’t even get in the ocean without the right super groveler. For slow waves, you need the fastest board – enjoy the Sub Xero.



Ride your Sub Xero approx. 4-6 inches shorter than your Xero in regular dimensions.

BLACK BARON



OLD SCHOOL SPEED, NEW SCHOOL FLAIR

After years of testing, this is the first twin fin ever released in the JS range, and we’ve timed it precisely to coincide with Parko’s step away from the world tour, and straight towards everything that’s just about the pure enjoyment of surfing. Immediately after announcing his retirement at JBay, Joel jumped onto this board to see one of his favourite breaks in the world with fresh eyes, and rode one wave the entire length of the point, grinning the whole way. He was hooked, and so were we.



By design, JS wanted our twin fin to be equal parts old school speed and new school flair. Foam in all the right places to float over soft sections and fly down the line, yet still allow you to lay it on rail or bust the fins even when you’re going Mach 10. Parko’s overwhelming standout from all of our R&D combined a flat rocker with vee throughout the board from nose to tail, with a balanced, maneuverable plan shape.



JS also tested the twin in a huge range of waves, from tiny beach breaks at home on the Gold Coast, to perfect overhead Cloudbreak. His favourite board? The exact same as Joel’s, with the perfect blend of strengths to make the most versatile twin of ‘em all, which is what we now call the Black Baron.



Whether you’re surfing weak beachies or quality, down the line points and reefs, the Black Baron is a hybrid that allows you to take whatever approach you’re interested in, from exploring new lines and just how fast you can go on a wave, to combining sharp rail turns with throwing the tail. Whatever way you go, it’s all about maximum fun.

RED BARON



CLASSIC LINES & MAXIMUM DRIVE.

Our Black Baron twin became a global favourite for mixing old school speed alongside new school flair, with enough versatility to let you ride it in weak beachies or quality, down the line points and reefs. Now we’ve created its little brother, the Red Baron, to take the same diverse approach, but added even more float and glide to really excel when other boards struggle.



Essentially, it’s ridden shorter and wider than your Black Baron, with slightly extra width in the tail outline also providing more flow and easy speed generation. Vee is maintained in the bottom contour throughout, like the original Baron, although a touch more double concave in the Red Baron provides drive and helps you project down the line. Ridden approximately 2 inches shorter than the Black Baron, another point of difference lies in the fins – we’ve designed the Red Baron to use a keel fin template, as the high area and depth delivers control and helps maintain incredible speed on rail. Classic keel fins offer maximum drive and hold, making sure you’re able to get creative even at high speeds on a much shorter board.



*Recommended fin choice – JS Keel Fin for Futures or FCSII Modern Keel template for FCSII bases.

FLAME FISH



THE LATEST AND GREATEST IN OUR LONG LINE OF SUPER GROVELERS

Our unparalleled epoxy technology, HYFI, is a unique multi-layer construction that feels like nothing else out there. Think of it as a futuristic exoskeleton for a surfboard that allows it to be lighter and stronger than ever before, while still maintaining the ideal spring-loaded flex for maximum performance. Now, in the last 5 years since it was first released, we’ve taken everything learned to improve each aspect – the performance, flex, speed, materials used and manufacturing processes.



The Flame Fish is designed for surfers who want to get the most out of even the weakest conditions. Whether you’re dedicated, or just downright desperate for waves, the Flame Fish sits apart in your quiver to maximise speed and ability to throw down manoeuvres. It’s not a jack of all trades, but the master of one – the small stuff.



A wide nose outline combined with a smooth, flat rocker gives you the extra paddle power and glide we all want in weak surf, complemented by a generous distribution of volume under the chest / front foot. A deeper single to double concave provides plenty of lift and easy rail-to-rail transitions, with full rails to reduce catch and increase speed through choppy or soft sections.



Ridden around the same length as your Flaming Pony or approximately 6 inches shorter than your Monsta Box all-rounder, the Flame Fish comes complete with its signature spray and unlimited speed to burn.

MONSTA 2020 YOUTH



FUN FOCUSSED, FUTURE FOCUSSED

20 years of JS Industries. 10 years since our flagship shortboard, the original Monsta, was first developed. Our new Monsta will be ridden everywhere from your most rewarding sessions at home & regular trips chasing waves, to Dream Tour events and the Olympic Games. Its latest version is the most complete all-rounder we’ve ever made, improved and fine-tuned by elite athletes, global ambassadors & local legends, together with our recently retired World Champ and JS.



The Monsta 2020 revolves around maximum performance, but with added forgiveness and fine tuning for each board’s desired conditions. We needed the new Monsta to provide spark for explosive manoeuvres in everyday waves, while being predictable and reliable in pumping surf from our backyard at Snapper & Kirra to destinations like Cloudbreak.



The rocker has been tweaked to provide a more generous sweet spot, which easily generates speed, allows you to control big turns, and balances release out of the lip. Compared to the Monsta 8, the nose has a touch more curve in the last few inches to prevent catching in critical parts of the wave. The same magic tail rocker remains to fit into the conditions our Monsta 2020 is designed to thrive in – almost any conditions from chest high to double overhead plus.



Single concave under front foot runs into a double concave through the fins to give you extra lift yet maintain control in powerful surf, while a clean outline flows into a slight hip that allows for responsive direction changes. Overall, the Monsta 2020 prompts intuitive & fast surfing. It’s a huge milestone for us, and now, it’s ready for the rest of the world to enjoy anywhere, anytime. The best always find a way to get better.

MISTER BENNETTS SIGNATURE



100% CARBON. GRIP AND COVER INCLUDED.

Foiling has evolved into a completely unique way to enjoy the ocean over the past few years, and the best equipment is evolving with it. Adam Bennetts is one of the world’s leading exponents – bringing surf inspired lines and turn angles to foiling, while finding new levels of speed and distance covered.



Adam’s natural talent combined with his sheer dedication and time in the water has resulted in an extensive R&D process to refine the next generation of foil boards. Throughout this process, his favourites were narrower overall with a new flyer to reduce width even further through the back 1/3 of the board. This allows more angle lean in turns without catching the rails on the surface of the water… And in his words, “now my turns have never looked and felt so smooth.”



We built the Mister Bennetts foil board to be as stiff as possible, ensuring all of your energy is transferred directly to the foil without losing force due to board flex. 100% carbon construction combined with twin stringers serve this purpose perfectly, while also keeping the board super light for effortless lift out of the water.



The twin stringers also reinforce the entire board for added strength, particularly around the futures single fin boxes holding the foil in place. A flat deck with a chine rail and deep double concave in the nose stops the board sticking to the water whenever it touches back down.



Additionally, this early double concave acts as two channels, helping you paddle straight, pop up and get to wave speed quickly. Remember – when sizing your foil board, similar to regular surfing, riding shorter boards makes turning much easier. As you become more comfortable, all you need is enough volume to float you comfortably, but initially, a few more litres will help with paddle power and stability.

MISTER BENNETTS EASY GLIDER



FOR EASY PADDLING AND EXTRA STABILITY.

The Easy Glider has all the same design features as its premium big brother, but no flyer. And exactly as the name suggests, it’s been designed with EasyRider style dimensions for super easy paddling and extra stability.



It’s also built differently, for those not requiring the same higher levels of rigidity. We’ve maximized our stringerless EPS technology to maintain stiffness and durability throughout, with high density foam reinforcements placed around the futures single fin boxes holding the foil in place.

BIG BARON SOFTBOARD



SOFT, BUT HARD TO PUT DOWN. FUN FOR ANYONE.

Soft boards are an incredibly fun addition to all surfer’s quivers, but evenmore essential for some. They allow kids and beginners to paddle (or be pushed) into waves without any fear of dinging themselves or the board. And for experienced surfers, they’re the perfect way to get in the water and have a good time no matter what, without any expectations. We want to make it easy for parents to help their children fall in love with surfing on a soft board, then go and sneak a few waves in themselves, even while using the same board. It’s the best of both worlds, and every reason you could ever need a foamie, all in one. To build the best soft boards possible, we’ve kept it simple.



Proven JS small wave shapes that you can actually manoeuvre, built to maximize durability and safety. It starts with the same top-quality materials and construction processes we use in our world-renowned JS range, and is finished with a soft 3mm PE shell all over, plus a microdot thermoform bottom. An EPS core is covered in 2x layers of 4-ounce glass on the deck and 1x layer of 4-ounce glass on the bottom. This maintains long lasting strength and the right weight to keep momentum when you’re surfing. A carbon T-Stringer provides extra stiffness and strength, with a more controlled flex that feels even better when flying down the line.

FLAME FISH SOFTBOARD



SOFT, BUT HARD TO PUT DOWN. FUN FOR ANYONE.

Soft boards are an incredibly fun addition to all surfer’s quivers, but evenmore essential for some. They allow kids and beginners to paddle (or be pushed) into waves without any fear of dinging themselves or the board. And for experienced surfers, they’re the perfect way to get in the water and have a good time no matter what, without any expectations. We want to make it easy for parents to help their children fall in love with surfing on a soft board, then go and sneak a few waves in themselves, even while using the same board. It’s the best of both worlds, and every reason you could ever need a foamie, all in one. To build the best soft boards possible, we’ve kept it simple.



Proven JS small wave shapes that you can actually manoeuvre, built to maximize durability and safety. It starts with the same top-quality materials and construction processes we use in our world-renowned JS range, and is finished with a soft 3mm PE shell all over, plus a microdot thermoform bottom. An EPS core is covered in 2x layers of 4-ounce glass on the deck and 1x layer of 4-ounce glass on the bottom. This maintains long lasting strength and the right weight to keep momentum when you’re surfing. A carbon T-Stringer provides extra stiffness and strength, with a more controlled flex that feels even better when flying down the line. The Flame Fish soft board also comes with a built in tail kick for extra support (Patent Pending).



JULIAN WILSON SOFTBOARD



The JW Signature Softboard combines all of the magic Julian and JS have found in their fun boards meant purely for switching off and enjoying the ocean. After testing a variety of super short designs of all shapes and sizes, we settled on a sleek parallel outline that would allow Jules to fit all the volume he needs into a 5’0”.



The finished product came together when JW and best mate Jimmy Lees took both of their families on a holiday up the coast (the only Australian alternative to down the coast), settled in for a long weekend, and chose the perfect craft to spin around on tiny sliders that would’ve been almost un-surfable on any other boards.



So this is what we’ve settled on for the JW Signature. Soft deck, hard bottom. Plus an inbuilt kicker for your back foot, a feature completely unique to JS softboards (patent pending). Ridden as a twin fin, or finless and purely reliant on the mini-channels running from nose to tail to keep you flying down the line and provide just enough grip. Either way, you’ll still need to embrace a friction-free and incredibly fast ride to keep even the most novelty conditions as entertaining as possible. Enjoy!

BLACK EAGLE



100% CARBON

We built our Black Eagle to be as stiff as possible, ensuring all of your energy is transferred directly to the foil without losing force due to board flex. 100% carbon construction combined with twin stringers serve this purpose perfectly, while also keeping the board super light for effortless lift out of the water.



The twin stringers also reinforce the entire board for added strength, particularly around the future boxes holding the foil in place. A scoop deck makes sure your feet are closer to the foil for quicker response, while beveled rails and deep double concave in the nose stops the board sticking to the water whenever it touches back down.



Additionally, this early double concave acts as two channels, helping you paddle straight, pop up and get to wave speed quickly.



Remember – when sizing your foil board, similar to regular surfing, riding shorter boards makes turning much easier. As you become more comfortable, all you need is enough volume to float you comfortably, but initially, a few more litres will help with paddle power and stability. See team rider reference below.

THE EAGLE



GRIP INCLUDED

The Eagle has all of the same design features as its premium big brother, but with a different construction for those not requiring the same higher levels of rigidity. We’ve maximized our stringerless EPS technology to maintain stiffness and durability throughout, with high density foam reinforcements placed around the future plugs holding the foil in place.
